		<p>
			Exciting isn&apos;t it? In 2018, we are embarking on a whistle&ndash;stop two&ndash;week holiday to 2 countries bordering on the Caribbean: Mexico and Cuba. These are both countries on my personal bucket&ndash;list of places to go to so I am excited to be doing this!
		</p>

		<p>
			I decided to produce this eBook to both practice what I alrerady knew about creating thse things and to make sure I recorded somewhere all of the stuff that I had found out and needed to pass on or remember. Whjo knows &ndash; maybe thsi can act as a template for future stuff?
		</p>

		<p>
			This eBook is divided into 3 main sections, namely:
			<ul>
				<li>Stuff to read about and do before we go,</li>
				<li>The trip itself, and</li>
				<li>Coming home at the end</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<p>
			If I think of any other stuff I&apos;ll put it into appendices at the end. So, without further ado, let&apos;s crack on!
		</p>

		<h1 id="ch2" class="chapter">Before We Go</h2>

		<p>
			Well before we start our trip, there are a few things to think about and do. I have splitn these up as follows:
			<ul>
				<li>Background: why we are going at this time of year, weather, distances etc.</li>
				<li>Health: what we need to do before we go (in terms of innoculations, tablets etc.)</li>
				<li>Travel: what are outbound long&ndash;haul flight details are, any considerations about time left on passports etc.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<p>
			I have also included as an Appendix what I envisage packing for the trip (excluding clothing - I am sure everyone can make up their own mainds about clothing!).
		</p>

		<h2>Background</h2>

		<h2>Health</h2>

		<h2>Travel</h2>

		<h1 id="ch3" class="chapter">The Trip</h2>

		<p>
			Each day of the trip is listed in its own mini&ndash;section below. Where I know these details, I&apos;ve tried to include times for any travelling we do on the day and the main sights we are seeing. The itinerary has been developed in conjunction with Journey Latin America and the contact details for them are included at the end of the book.
		</p>

		<p>
			The long&ndash;haul travel days are also mentioned in the Before We Go and Coming Home sections of this book.
		</p>

		<h2>Day 1 Friday 23<sup>rd</sup> November   UK to Oaxaca</h2>

		<p>
			Our flight from London Heathrow is AeroMexico flight number XXXXXX which departs at 2340 from  London HeathRow. Check&ndash;in must be done by 2140. Each person can have one suitcase (for placing in the hold &ndash; maximum 23kg) and one carry&ndfash;on bag / backpack &ndash; normal for long&ndash;flights.
		</p>

		<h2>Day 2 Saturday 24<sup>th</sup> November   Oaxaca</h2>

		<p>
			We arrive in Mexico City airport at about 0420 in the morning and have to cvatch an internal flight to Oaxaca by 0605 (our bags transfer automatically, I think). We then arrive in Oaxaca airport at about 0720 and will be able to check&ndash;in to our hotel on arrival.
