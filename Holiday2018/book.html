		<h1 id="ch1" class="chapter">Introduction</h1>

		<p>
			Exciting isn&apos;t it? In 2018, we are embarking on a whistle&ndash;stop two&ndash;week holiday to 2 countries bordering on the Caribbean: Mexico and Cuba. These are both countries on my personal bucket&ndash;list of places to go to so I am excited to be doing this!
		</p>

		<p>
			I decided to produce this eBook to both practice what I already knew about creating these things and to make sure I recorded somewhere all of the stuff that I had found out and needed to pass on or remember. Who knows &ndash; maybe this can act as a template for future holiday stuff?
		</p>

		<p>
			This eBook is divided into 3 main sections, namely:
			<ul>
				<li>Stuff to read about and do before we go,</li>
				<li>The trip itself, and</li>
				<li>Coming home at the end</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<p>
			If I think of any other stuff I&apos;ll put it into appendices at the end. So, without further ado, let&apos;s crack on!
		</p>

		<h1 id="ch2" class="chapter">Before We Go</h2>

		<p>
			Well before we start our trip, there are a few things to think about and do. I have split these up as follows:
			<ul>
				<li>Background: why we are going at this time of year, weather, distances etc.</li>
				<li>Health: what we need to do before we go (in terms of innoculations, tablets etc.)</li>
				<li>Travel: what our outbound long&ndash;haul flight details are, any considerations about time left on passports etc.</li>
				<li>Money: what the local currencies are, advice from journey planners re use of credit cards etc.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<p>
			I have also included as an Appendix what I envisage packing for the trip (excluding clothing - I am sure everyone can make up their own minds about clothing!).
		</p>

		<h2>Background</h2>

		<p>
			Both Mexico and Cuba have coastline with the Caribbean. The Caribbean area is warm for most of the year (the Gulf Stream kick starts here) so temperatures are generally pleasant, but it is humid at times. Additionally, this area suffers each year from a period of high hurricane probability, generally from August through to mid-November. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Taking this into account, and taking advice from the major tourist web sites, we are timing our holiday just after the hurricane season finishes and just before temperatures rise. This is also the best time to visit as it precedes the major tourist season from late December through April. We fly out of the UK on <strong>Friday 23<sup>rd</sup> November</strong> and return on <strong>Sunday 9<sup>th</sup> December</strong>.
		</p>

		<p>
			Mexico is a country of approx. 130 million people and nearly 2 million square kilometres in size; Cuba is much smaller: approx. 12 million people and  110,000 square kilometrees in size. The UK lies between these two, having a population of approaching 70 million people crammed into nearly 250,000 square kilometres of land mass. 
		</p>

		<img src="./images/Resized/map-mexico.png" width="400px" />

		<p>
			We will be visitng 3 regions in Mexico:<br />
			<ul>
				<li>Oaxaca &ndash; including Monte Alban and Hierve el Agua</li>
				<li>Yucatan &ndash; inclduing Chichen Itza and Merida</li>
				<li>Central area &ndash; including Puebla and Mexico City itself</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<img src="./images/Resized/map-cuba.png" width="400px" />

		<p>
			Our visit to Cuba will only take in two areas:<br />
			<ul>
				<li>Havana &ndash; Cuba&apos;s bustling capital city, and</li>
				<li>Trinidad &ndash; passing through the Santa Clara region</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<h2>Health</h2>

		<p>
			Do check with your GP about what innoculations they advise for your personal circumstances for this trip. They will normally check for whether you are up to date with vaccines for cholera, typhoid, Hepatitis A and Tetanus &ndash; I had to have a tetanus jab and a Hepatitis A one as well (because I only had a combined Hep A + B jab when we travelled to Vietnam and Cambodia which only lasts for a short time).
		</p>

		<p>
			Make sure and get them to bring your vaccination record card up to date an store it somewhere safe.
		</p>

		<p>
			Our GP surgery also gave me two web sites to check:
			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://nathnac.net/">National Travel Health Network and Centre </a>, and</li>
				<li><a href="https://www.fitfortravel.nhs.uk/home">Fit For Travel</a></li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<p>
			I did ask about rabies and malaria. Alhough both countries are tropical, malaria risk is classed as Low and Hampton GP&apos;s are not recommending a course of malaria tablets for our visit. The risk of rabies is roughly the same for Cuba/Mexico as it was for Vietnam/Cambodia. The rabies jab does not offer full protection anyway; it just delays the progress of rabies if you have been bitten until you can get to some proper medical facilities. That being the case, we may do the same as we did for Vietnam/Cambodia &ndash; not have the rabies jab &ndash; and remain careful while on holiday around animals.
		</p>

		<p>
			The tour company did mention about having an up&ndash;to&ndash;date Yellow Fever vaccination record or you might not get back into the UK but the Hampton Surgey dismissed that - see what your own GP&apos;s say where you are.
		</p>

		<a id="travel"><h2>Travel</h2></a>

		<p>
			Mexico and Cuba are in different time zones:<br />
			<ul>
				<li>Mexico &ndash; GMT &ndash;6 hours</li>
				<li>Cuba &ndash; GMT &ndash;5 hours</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<p>
			We are travelling a significant distance during this holiday, both by air and by road. The table below shows the main travelling and what the distances involved are for each major trip. <i>(if I have time before we go I'll put in a summary table showing comparative holiday travelling for other long&ndash;haul holidays as well)</i>

		<h2>Money</h2>

		<p>
			Both Mexico and Cuba have the peso as their unit of currency but they are separate currencies with separate exchange rates, similar to US and Canadian dollars in that respect.
		</p>

		<p>
			Mexico has a more developed ATM and credit-card capability. Not sure how useful the FairFX card will be &ndash; need to check with them. You are recommended to let your bank know that you will be using your card(s) in these countries before you leave.
		</p>

		<p>
			Current exchange rates (as at Friday 17 August) are:<br />
			<ul type="none">
				<li>Mexican Peso: 24.28 pesos per UK &pound;</li>
				<li>Cuban peso:   1.27 pesos per UK &pound;</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<p style="border:1px solid black;background-color:#c9c9c9;font-weight:bold;padding:20px;text-align:center;">
			<i>N.B.  It may not be possible to buy Cuban pesos outside of Cuba. If that is the case, we will have to take sufficient UK/US cash to use to buy some when we get there.</i>
		</p>

		<h2>Electricity</h2>

		<p>
			Both Mexico and Cuba have different electricty supply and plug sockets to the UK. In Mexico the power sockets are of type A and B. The standard voltage is 127 V and the standard frequency is 60 Hz. In Cuba the power sockets are of type A, B, C and L. The standard voltage is 110 / 220 V and the standard frequency is 60 Hz. Pictures of the various socket types are shown below.
		</p>

		<table cellpadding="5" border="0">

				<td><img src="./images/TypeASocket.jpg" width="150px" height="130px" alt="Type A Socket"></td>

		<p>
			So we will need travel adapters and (maybe) voltage adapters as well so we can have our 4-way blocks plugged in at our various accommodations.
		</p>

		<h1 id="ch3" class="chapter">The Trip</h1>

		<p>
			I have grouped everything below by each of our accommodation destinations and then, each day of the trip is listed in its own mini&ndash;section. Where I know these details, I&apos;ve tried to include times for any travelling we do on the day and the main sights we are seeing. The itinerary has been developed in conjunction with Journey Latin America and the contact details for them are included at the end of the book.
		</p>

		<p>
			The long&ndash;haul travel days are also mentioned in the <a href="#ch2">Before We Go</a> and <a href="#ch4">Coming Home</a> sections of this book.
		</p>


		<h4>Day 1 Friday 23<sup>rd</sup> November   UK to Oaxaca</h4>
		<p>
			Our flight from London Heathrow is AeroMexico flight number AM0008 which departs at 2340 from  London HeathRow. Check&ndash;in must be done by 2140. Each person can have one suitcase (for placing in the hold &ndash; maximum 23kg) and one carry&ndash;on bag / backpack &ndash; normal for long&ndash;haul flights.
		</p>

		<h4>Day 2 Saturday 24<sup>th</sup> November   Oaxaca</h3>

		<p>
			We arrive in Mexico City airport at about 0420 in the morning and have to catch an internal flight to Oaxaca at 0605 (our bags transfer automatically, I think). We then arrive in Oaxaca airport at about 0720 and will be able to check&ndash;in to our hotel on arrival.
		</p>

		<h3>Oaxaca</h3>

		<img src="./images/Resized/Oaxaca.png" height="400" alt="Oaxaca" />

		<h4>Day 2 Saturday 24<sup>th</sup> November   Oaxaca</h4>
		<p>
			We are staying in Oaxaca for two nights at the Catrina de Alcala hotel
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Afternoon: Half&ndash;day private excursion for Oaxacan street food and Mezcal tasting</strong>. Need to stay awake for this one as Oaxaca is meant to be one of the culinary highs of Mexico.
		</p>

		<h4>Day 3 Sunday 25<sup>th</sup> November  Monte Alban and Hierve el Agua</h3>
		<img src="./images/Resized/MonteAlban1.png" height="400" alt="Monte Alban" />

		<p>
			<strong>Full&ndash;day private excursion to Monte Alban and Hierve el Agua</strong>. Monte Alban are our first experience of Mayan ruins; Hierve el Agua may allow us to bathe in one of the pools if we want (depends on weather and temperature of the water, I suggest!) and the ride to/from Hierve el Agua is meant to be &quot;interesting&quot;!
		</p>
		<img src="./images/Resized/HierveElAgua1.png" height="400" alt="Petrified waterfall at Hierve el Agua" />

		<h3>Merida</h3>
		<img src="./images/Resized/Merida2.png" height="400" alt="Merida" />

		<h4>Day 4 Monday 26<sup>th</sup> November   Oaxaca to Merida</h4>

		<p>
			We are staying for two nights at the Hotel Boutique Casa Lucia in Merida.
		</p>

		<p>
			Arrive at Merida airport at approx. 1328. Afternoon at leisure after hotel check&ndash;in. Possible things to do this afternoon include:
			<ul>
				<li>(I'll fill this in later when I've done some Googling)</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<h4>Day 5 Tuesday 27<sup>th</sup> November   Merida</h3>

		<p>
			Merida city tour - two to three hour excursion (<i>No start time specified</i>). Need to know this from guide or hotel the day beforehand. 
		</p>

		<h3>Chichen Itza</h3>
		<img src="./images/Resized/chichen-itza.png" height="400" alt="Chichen Itza" />

		<h4>Day 6 Wednesday 28<sup>th</sup> November   Merida to Chichen Itza</h4>

		<p>
			We are staying for two nights at the Mayaland and Bunglaows Hotel in Chichen Itza.
		</p>

		<p style="border:2px solid red;background-color:#c5c9c9;font-weight:bold;padding:20px;textalign:center;">
			N.B.  This is an early start day, leaving at about 0830. Be up early if you want any breakfast!
		</p>

		<p>
			Two and a half hour road trip to Chichen Itza from Merida, arriving there at around 11am (so leave hotel at about 0830). Private air&ndash;conditioned vehicle &ndash; lunch included during or before the half-day excursion to Chichen Itza ruins. Chichen Itza is the most fanmous (with tourists) Mayan ruin enclosure in Mexico so expect crowds.
		</p>

		<h4>Day 7 Thursday 29<sup>th</sup> November   Yucatan Sights</h4>
		<h5>Main cenotes day!</h5>
		<img src="./images/Resized/ik-kil1.png" height="400" alt="Ik Kil" />

		<p>
			Ek&ndash;Balam &amp; Valladolid with Ik Kil &amp; Samula cenotes. Full day private excursion.
		</p>

		<p>
			If we want to, we should be able to climb the main pyramid at Ek Balam and get views all around &ndash; we won&apos;t be able to do this at Chichn Itza; Ik Kil and Samula are two of the most photogenic cenotes in the Yucatan and we may be able to briefly swim at one or both :-) bring your swimming gear! They are also two of the most popular, so expect crowds/queues.
		</p>

		<p>
			Our hotel is close enough to the main Chichen Itza ruins if we want to revisit this evening (depending on what time we get back).
		</p>

		<h4>Day 8 Friday 30<sup>th</sup> November   Chichen Itza to Havana</h4>

		<p style="border:2px solid red;background-color:#c5c9c9;font-weight:bold;padding:20px;textalign:center;">
			N.B.  This is a VERY early start day, leaving at about 0800. Again, be up early if you want any breakfast!
		</p>

		<p>
			Private transfer to Cancun airport leaving at about 0800. Flight from Cancun at 1354 to Havana, arriving at 1512. Transfer to Hotel Inglaterra for 3 nights.
		</p>

		<h3>Havana</h3>
		<img src="./images/Resized/Havana1.png" height="400" alt="Havana streets" />

		<p>
			We are staying for three nights at the Hotel Inglaterra in Havana Old Town. Rest of the first afternon and evening at leisure. There appear to be a number of coffee shops in the vicinity of the hotel :-)
		</p>

		<p>
			NOTE: We have been warned that accommodation in Cuba is not likely to be as modern or well provided for as in Mexico but it will be clean and safe. We may have issues with wifi in the hotel so if all else fails see if we can get reception in a local coffee shop :-) What a hardship!
		</p>

		<h4>Day 9 Saturday 1<sup>st</sup> December   Havana</h4>
		<img src="./images/Resized/havana_musicians.png" height="400" alt="Havana street usicians in the Old Town" />

		<p>
			Half&ndash;day walking tour of Old Havana - prepare to start early! Most cafes and coffee houses are in the Old Town so smile!
		</p>

		<p>
			This afternoon we join a shared excursion to the Rum Museum - this is a one hour tour shared with other holidaymakers. Various start times in the day. We need to check with our local guide when this starts and from where.
		</p>

		<p>
			Rest of the day ane evening at leisure - so, walking :-)
		</p>


		<h4>Day 10 Sunday 2<sup>nd</sup> December   Havana</h3>
		<img src="./images/Resized/Havana2.png" height="400" alt="Havana old-style cars are everywhere" />

		<p>
			Day at leisure in Havana so we need to think of possibilities for the day. Maybe:
			<ul>
				<li>do the Cuban Art Gallery and Christopher Columbus (Colon) cemetery &ndash; as they are within 10 minutes walk of each other; 
				</li>
				<<li>maybe take a taxi to the Hemingway Museum (its down as a 2.5 to 3 hour walk);</li> 
				<<li>maybe take a taxi to the El Morro fortress across the bay (views back over the town);</li>
				<<li>maybe take a taxi just out of Havana along the coast a bit?</li>
				<li>maybe look up some Cuban jazz for the evening (Buena Visat social club)</li> 
			</ul>
			(<i> I'll try and come up with some more ideas</i>).
		</p>

		<h3>Trinidad</h3>
		<img src="./images/Resized/Trinidad1.png" height="400" alt="Rooftops in Trinidad" />

		<h4>Day 11 Monday 3<sup>rd</sup> December   Havana to Trinidad</h4>
		<p>
			Travel by road via the Che Guevara Santa Clara area, photos. Museum not open on Mondays.
		</p>

		<p>
			After our journey, we check in to our Trinidad homestay and then have a Trinidad colonial city walking tour &ndash; a half&ndash;day private excursion with lunch inlcuded. We will be staying for two nights at the <strong>Casa Luis XVIII Homestay</strong> in Trinidad. Our evening meal on this first day here at the homestay is included - maybe chance to meet some locals?
		</p>

		<img src="./images/Resized/Trinidad2.png" height="400" alt="Street scene in Trinidad" />

		<h4>Day 12 Tuesday 4<sup>th</sup> December   Trinidad</h4>

		<p>
			We have this as a day at leisure in Trinidad to do our own thing: 
			<ul>
				<<li>we could take a trip to Cienfuegos or the Bay of Pigs (up the coast); </li>
				<<li>we could check out the coast area in Trinidad and lounge around; </li>
				<li>we may be able to see if there are any tourist boat trips to go on;</li>
				<<li>we could take a trip out into the countryside or back to Santa Clara if we want to find out more about Che Guevara</li> 
			</ul>
			&ndash; lots of options to consider.
		</p>

		<h4>Day 13 Wednesday 5<sup>th</sup> December   Trinidad to Mexico City</h3>

		<p style="border:2px solid red;background-color:#c5c9c9;font-weight:bold;padding:20px;textalign:center;">
			N.B.  This is a long travelling day, with quite an early start. We retrace our road trip back from Trinidad to Havana (5+ hours) and then fly from Havana to Mexico City. Once again, be up early if you want any breakfast!
		</p>

		<h3>Mexico City</h3>
		<img src="./images/Resized/MexicoCity1.png" height="400" alt="One of the main squares in Mexico City" />

		<p>
			We will be staying for three nights at the<strong>Historico Central</strong> in Mexico City. Remainder of this day at leisure.
		</p>

		<h4>Day 14 Thursday 6<sup>th</sup> December   Guadalupe</h4>

		<p>
			Full day shared excursion to the Teotihuacan pyramids and Guadalupe shrine. No idea about lunch - maybe buy something at one of the places?
		</p>

		<h4>Day 15 Friday 7<sup>th</sup> December   Puebla</h4>
		<img src="./images/Resized/Puebla1.png" height="400" alt="Street scene in Puebla" />

		<p>
			Full day private excursion to Puebla, Tonantzintla and Cholula. From Cholula, we should get magnificient views of Mexico's largest volcano &ndash; Popacatapetl but we probably will not have time to try and climb it :-( 
		</p>

		<h4>Day 16 Saturday 8<sup>th</sup> December   Mexico City</h4>

		<p>
			Our homeward lomg&ndash;haul flight today from Mexico City is AeroMexico flight number AM0007 which departs at 2340. Must do the online check&ndash;in for the long haul flight before we leave the hotel. Baggage check&ndash;in must be done by 2140. As for the outbound long&ndash;haul flight, each person can have one suitcase (for placing in the hold &ndash; maximum 23kg) and one carry&ndash;on bag / backpack &ndash; normal for long&ndash;haul flights.
		</p>

		<p>
			We have a late checkout from our hotel today (around 6pm) so we retain the use of the room up until tea time - good news for freshening up for the long journey home! We will be picked up from the hotel by our airport transfer at any time betyween 7.30 and 8.00 pm
		</p>


		<h4>Day 17 Sunday 9<sup>th</sup> December   UK</h4>

		<p>
			We arrive back in the UK at London HeathRow at approx. 3.50pm.
		</p>

		<h1 id="ch4" class="chapter">Coming Home</h1>

		<p>
			Arriving at Heathrow at about 3.50pm, Terminal 4, we will then have to catch our onward transport &ndash; Sophie to Bedford and Em coming with us on the coach to Hampton? (<i>I'll update this bit with coach journey times for the three of us who are travelling back to Hampton when I know them.</i>)

			As part of the final itinerary confirmation, we have been given access to the information via an app that can be downloaded from Apple App Store. The app to look for is <strong>Vamoos</strong>. Ideally, download this to an iPad as the displays are quite big, but it should still work to some degree on an iPhone.
		</p>

		<p>
			Aftre you have downloaded the app, start it up and you will then need to sign&ndash;in to the app to get to our holiday details. Our sign&ndash;in details are:<br/>
			<table>
				<tr>
					<td>Username:</td>
					<td>JLA</td>

				<tr>
					<td>Password:</td>
					<td>358130CAB</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		</p>

		<p>
			The app will offer you the opportunity to download some maps - not OS maps but OK. When connected to wifi, you should do this so that things are still accessible on-the-go.
