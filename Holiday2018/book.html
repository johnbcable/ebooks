		<p>
			Exciting isn&apos;t it? In 2018, we are embarking on a whistle&ndash;stop two&ndash;week holiday to 2 countries bordering on the Caribbean: Mexico and Cuba. These are both countries on my personal bucket&ndash;list of places to go to so I am excited to be doing this!
		</p>

		<p>
			I decided to produce this eBook to both practice what I already knew about creating these things and to make sure I recorded somewhere all of the stuff that I had found out and needed to pass on or remember. Who knows &ndash; maybe this can act as a template for future holiday stuff?
		</p>

		<p>
			This eBook is divided into 3 main sections, namely:
			<ul>
				<li>Stuff to read about and do before we go,</li>
				<li>The trip itself, and</li>
				<li>Coming home at the end</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<p>
			If I think of any other stuff I&apos;ll put it into appendices at the end. So, without further ado, let&apos;s crack on!
		</p>

		<h1 id="ch2" class="chapter">Before We Go</h2>

		<p>
			Well before we start our trip, there are a few things to think about and do. I have split these up as follows:
			<ul>
				<li>Background: why we are going at this time of year, weather, distances etc.</li>
				<li>Health: what we need to do before we go (in terms of innoculations, tablets etc.)</li>
				<li>Travel: what our outbound long&ndash;haul flight details are, any considerations about time left on passports etc.</li>
				<li>Money: what the local currencies are, advice from journey planners re use of credit cards etc.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<p>
			I have also included as an Appendix what I envisage packing for the trip (excluding clothing - I am sure everyone can make up their own minds about clothing!).

		<h1 id="ch3" class="chapter">The Trip</h2>

		<p>
			Each day of the trip is listed in its own mini&ndash;section below. Where I know these details, I&apos;ve tried to include times for any travelling we do on the day and the main sights we are seeing. The itinerary has been developed in conjunction with Journey Latin America and the contact details for them are included at the end of the book.
		</p>

		<p>
			The long&ndash;haul travel days are also mentioned in the <a href="#ch2">Before We Go</a> and <a href="#ch4">Coming Home</a> sections of this book.
