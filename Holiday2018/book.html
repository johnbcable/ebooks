		<p>
			Exciting isn&apos;t it? In 2018, we are embarking on a whistle&ndash;stop two&ndash;week holiday to 2 countries bordering on the Caribbean: Mexico and Cuba. These are both countries on my personal bucket&ndash;list of places to go to so I am excited to be doing this!
		</p>

		<p>
			I decided to produce this eBook to both practice what I already knew about creating these things and to make sure I recorded somewhere all of the stuff that I had found out and needed to pass on or remember. Who knows &ndash; maybe this can act as a template for future holiday stuff?
		</p>

		<p>
			This eBook is divided into 3 main sections, namely:
			<ul>
				<li>Stuff to read about and do before we go,</li>
				<li>The trip itself, and</li>
				<li>Coming home at the end</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<p>
			If I think of any other stuff I&apos;ll put it into appendices at the end. So, without further ado, let&apos;s crack on!
		</p>

		<h1 id="ch2" class="chapter">Before We Go</h2>

		<p>
			Well before we start our trip, there are a few things to think about and do. I have split these up as follows:
			<ul>
				<li>Background: why we are going at this time of year, weather, distances etc.</li>
				<li>Health: what we need to do before we go (in terms of innoculations, tablets etc.)</li>
				<li>Travel: what our outbound long&ndash;haul flight details are, any considerations about time left on passports etc.</li>
				<li>Money: what the local currencies are, advice from journey planners re use of credit cards etc.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<p>
			I have also included as an Appendix what I envisage packing for the trip (excluding clothing - I am sure everyone can make up their own minds about clothing!).
		</p>

		<h2>Background</h2>

		<p>
			Both Mexico and Cuba have coastline with the Caribbean. The Caribbean area is warm for most of the year (the Gulf Stream kick starts here) so temperatures are generally pleasant, but it is humid at times. Additionally, this area suffers each year from a period of high hurricane probability, generally from August through to mid-November. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Takling this into account, and taking advice from the major tourist web sites, we are timing our holiday just after the hurricane season finishes and just before temperatures rise. This is also the best time to visit as it precedes the major tourist season from late December through April. We fly out of the UK on <strong>Friday 23<sup>rd</sup> November</strong> and return on <strong>Sunday 9<sup>th</sup> December</strong>.
		</p>

		<p>
			While we are away we will cover quite large distances as we travel around (and between) Mexico and Cuba, both by air and by road. The table below gives you some idea of the distances involved.
		</p>

		<h2>Health</h2>

		<h2>Travel</h2>

		<p>
			Mexico and Cuba are in different time zones:<br />
			<ul>
				<li>Mexico &ndash; GMT &ndash;6 hours</li>
				<li>Cuba &ndash; GMT &ndash;5 hours</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<p>
			Wew are travelling significant distance during this holiday, both by air and by road. The table below shows the main travelling and what the distances involved are for each major trip. <i>(if I have time I'll put in a summary table showing comparaive holidaty travelling for other long&ndash;haul holidays as well)</i>

		<h2>Money</h2>

		<p>
			Both Mexico and Cuba have the peso as their unit of currency but they are separate currencies with separate exchange rates, similar to US and Canadian dollars in that respect.
		</p>

		<p>
			Mexico has a more developed ATM and credit-card capability. Not sure how useful the FairFX card will be &ndash; need to check with them. You are recommended to let your bank know that you will be using your card(s) in these countries before you leave
		</p>

		<p>
			Current exchange rates (as at Friday 17 August) are:<br />
			<ul type="none">
				<li>Mexican Peso: 24.28 pesos per UK &pound;</li>
				<li>Cuban peso:   1.27 pesos per UK &pound;</li>
			</ul>
