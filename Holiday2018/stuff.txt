Oaxaca

It´s always good to visit Oaxaca, a city recognized by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site. In March, for example, the jacarandas bloom, emphasizing the greenish of its original quarry stone. Oaxaca is one of the cities where all the historical periods of Mexico shine: pre-Hispanic, colonial, independent, modern, and contemporary are expressed with its natural elegance in every street, colonial building, museum, magical festival, colorful crafts, pre-Columbian ruins, and the many splendorous baroque churches that are to be found in every corner of the city.

Ecotourism, fluorescent lagoons, lush mountains, archaeological sites, colonial treasures, culture, crafts, gastronomy, folklore, parties and many more great experiences will set the tone of your vacation in Oaxaca, the third best city in Central and South America according to Travel and Leisure magazine.

Puebla

This city was an afterthought when planning my trip to Mexico. It ended up being a highlight.

Puebla, the 4th largest Mexican city with a population of 1.5 million, is located 75 miles from Mexico City. The Historical Center (named a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1987) is packed with colorful colonial buildings, churches, monuments, and the most beautiful zocalo (main square) that I’ve seen in Mexico.

-The historic center of Puebla was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in December of 1987. With 2,619 monuments, the city has the largest number of monuments in the Americas.
-Puebla is sometimes called ‘City of Street Lights’ due to the numerous decorative street lamps crafted by the French. The French legacy can also be seen in the city’s elaborate wrought iron balconies and the fine crystal chandeliers adorning historic buildings.
-Puebla is one of the richest cities in Mexico and is considered to have the highest quality of life in the country due to its wealth and safety (2nd only to Tlaxcala) .
-Puebla has the largest Volkswagen factory in the world outside of Germany.
-Puebla is home to the first public library in the Americas, the Biblioteca Palafoxiana, which is the only remaining library from the Spanish Colonial period.
-Puebla’s culinary tradition, known as Cocina Poblana, is popular throughout Mexico. A distinctive feature of the region’s cooking is mole, a rich, spicy sauce containing chocolate, cinnamon and nuts as well as different types of hot peppers. Mole is the most renowned of Puebla’s dishes.
-The Cinco de Mayo holiday has its roots in Puebla. In 1862, France invaded Mexico, planning to make it part of the French Empire. Outnumbered Mexican forces met the French at Puebla and managed to defeat the French army (many of who were weakened by diarrhea). This is the reason for the Cinco de Mayo celebrations in the US and Mexico every year and also the reason that streets all over Mexico are named Cinco de Mayo. What few know is that the French came back the following year, won, and occupied Puebla until 1867.
–Talavera ceramics (pictured below at the Casa de la Cultura) are unique to Puebla and many of the buildings in the Centro Historico have these beautifully painted tiles adorning their walls.
The Amparo museum is an art/history museum with one of the largest pre-Hispanic art collections of any museum in Mexico. It also showcases temporary exhibits by current artists, most with a Mexican or Latin flavor (they had a exhibit by a Brazilian photographer while we were there). But the museum is worth seeing for its architecture alone – it is a beautifully constructed building of glass and steel highlighted by a rooftop café featuring some of the best views of Puebla. Tip: Museum is free on Mondays.
Half an hour from downtown Puebla, Cholula is both a historical and scenic highlight in the region. Built here starting around the 3rd century BC is the Great Pyramid of Cholula (also known as Tlachihualtepetl), the largest pyramid ever built, even surpassing the Great Pyramid of Giza in Egypt. Abandoned around the 8th century AD, it became overgrown and by the time the Spanish showed up in the 1500s the Pyramid was covered by earth. Cholula became the site of a major battle in 1519 in which the Spanish defeated the Aztecs. The Spanish, as they liked to do, built a church over the ‘pagan’ site of the Pyramid. Today you can visit the site, explore the tunnels of the pyramid, and climb up the hill to the church (Iglesia de Nuestra Señora de los Remedios). Cholula is fascinating and worth a full day visit. This post covers Cholula in much more detail.
