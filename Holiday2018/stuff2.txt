A popular item that travellers buy at duty-free is the famous Havana Rum.

However, many travellers have also reported that they then have it confiscated from them when going through a connecting airport such as LA or Madrid.

This is because it is compulsory for any alcohol to be sealed in a duty-free clear plastic bag with the receipt inside it.

Without this, it means that going through check in at the connecting airport will then be legally obligated to throw it away or alternatively, check it in as luggage at an extra cost.

A tourist visa is compulsory for those heading to Cuba.

Holidaymakers will need to produce the document at customs to be allowed through, as well as valid travel insurance to be allowed to enter.

Without them both, they risk being turned away after landing.
