		<h1 id="ch1" class="chapter">Introduction</h1>

		<p>
			This ebook is one of two which contain transcripts of the online lectures provided as part of the Modern Foreign Languages Programme jointly provided online by the <a href="http://warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/cpe/">Centre for Professional Education at the University of Warwick</a>, <a href="http://vle.thw.coventry.sch.uk/web/">Tile Hill Wood School &amp; Language College</a> and <a href="http://howesprimary.co.uk">Howes Primary School</a>. Grant funding was provided by the Department for Education to develop CPD courses for MFL Primary school teachers. 
		</p>
		<p>
			This book is organised in sequence with the structure of the online Primary MFL CPD course It covers information for teaching years 5 &amp; 6 in relation to listening &amp; speaking; reading; writing and grammar. A prior volume of transcripts covers equivalent sections for teaching years 3 &amp; 4.

		<h1 id="ch2" class="chapter">Listening &amp; Speaking</h1>

		<h2 id="sec21" class="chapter">Session Objectives</h2>

		<p>
			By the end of this session, you will have developed an understanding of the age-related expectations for Year 5 and 6 in speaking and listening.  The more we talk about year 5 and 6, we’re looking at children who are in their third and fourth year of language learning.  You will also feel confident to assess progress in speaking and listening by using the assessment grids which we’ll be demonstrating later on.  You will also feel confident in planning for progression by using the suggested pathways that we’ve prepared.
		</p>

		<p>
			We’ll then look at factors that might demotivate students and put them off listening and speaking, common barriers and look at a range of teaching techniques and ideas how to overcome those listening and speaking specific barriers and finally, we’ll look at – we’ll signpost you to a few resources and we’ll showcase one of them in a bit more detail.
		</p>

		<h2 id="sec22" class="chapter">Age Related Expectations</h2>

		<h3 id="sec221">Progression Matrix</h3>

		<p>
			We’re now going to look in more detail at the age-related expectations for Year 5 and 6 in speaking and listening.  In the white box you’ll see the DfE statutory requirements and how it’s been broken down and into Year 5 and 6.  In terms of listening in Year 5 and 6, you will gradually develop confidence to listen to longer texts.  In Year 5, they may have to listen to short messages and note the main points, whereas, by the time they’re in Year 6, they’ll be listening to longer texts.  Also, they’ll be listening to unfamiliar vocabulary and starting to be able to identify the main points of this, as opposed to Year 5, when it’s more focused on classroom instructions and a range of questions based on the topics that they’re familiar with.
		</p>

		<p>
			So, in terms of speaking, we’re now moving from the short phrases and sentences. They learned in their first two years of language learning to in Year 5, expressing unjustifying opinions or I like this because, ask me for an opinion, having conversations about topics they have been learning about and then towards the end of Key Stage 2, they have a range of opinions and they can connect those complex sentences, so, I like football because it’s exciting, but I don’t like tennis because it’s boring, those kind of – and then have a conversation about different topics, expressing those opinions and then also they can have a range of sentences in the target language that they can ask for clarification.
		</p>

		<p>
			So, on this slide of the progression matrix, we’re looking at the phonic knowledge and how that increases towards the end of Key Stage 2 and that they then pronounce the range of other language and it’s more that they’re increasing confidence and accuracy over the last two years, than any specific skill they’re adding and also when they speak, that their intonation is increasingly accurate and that they’re confident about it and the last point with the presentation is that obviously they prepare something over time, it could be pieced together for a piece of work that they’ve done over the course of Year 6 and it would also be a lot of language that they use in Year 5 and 4, but that all comes together at the end, although they could give a presentation that they’ve prepared in short paragraphs, put it together and present that to the class.
		</p>

		<h2 id="sec23" class="chapter">Year 5 Assessment</h3>

		<h3 id="sec231">Assessment Grid</h3>

		<p>
			And you can see here, the assessment grid for Year 5 in speaking and listening.  This matches up with the progression matrix so that you can use a progression matrix to help you plan and then use the assessment grid at the end to highlight the children who are making the expected progress, or working towards or working above.
		</p>

		<h3 id="sec232">Examples</h3>

		<p>
			So here you can see some exemplar materials of what speaking and listening will look like by the end of Year 5 and if you look in the expected, children are given the opportunity, not just to present about themselves, or present on certain topics, but they’re presenting across a range of text types, so in this example, they’re presenting instructions, but you equally might use poetry, might use plays, so this is the example of what standard the children are reaching.  You can see the children who are exceeding, they’re using additional features, such as adverbs, adverbial phrases, to extend themselves.
		</p>

		<h2 id="sec24" class="chapter">Year 6 Assessment</h2>

		<h3 id="sec241">Assessment Grid</h3>

		<p>
			So here you can see the section of speaking and listening taken from the Year 6 assessment grid, again, based on the matrix we discussed earlier and bullet points allowing you to judge whether your student or your class have reached – are emerging, expected or above where they should be.
		</p>

		<h3 id="sec242">Example</h3>

		<p>
			So we’ve put together three illustrations of what speaking could look like at the end of their fourth year of learning one language, so, in English, so you can adapt that and you can see, as I mentioned before, there is a lot of language that they’ve started, that they didn’t just learn in Year 6, it goes spirally over the Year 3, 4 and 5 curriculum as well.  So, it might look like it’s a lot of things to talk about, but it’s actually building on what they’ve learned in previous years and they might just piece that together over the course of Year 6, so they can present that at the end of year 6, and you can see the difference in emerging and expected – we’ve focused on linking several sentences, what they can and can’t do, it’s present tense, whether it’s also an I would like in there, their opinions and the connectors for that and a bit more detail as well and they expect it and on the next slide, you’ll see exceeding.
		</p>

		<p>
			So here is the example where a child would exceed their age-related expectations and you can see, it’s not massively more than they expected, it’s more a few phrases that are more complex or using a complex phrase several times. So the example we’ve put in here is, if they live in the South of France, they can go to the beach and it’s repeated, that comes up twice.  There are a lot of children and they have lunch at school and also got the after lunch lessons before they go home, there’s that extra bit of detail – using the more complex structures more confidently and more regularly with greater accuracy would then mean they exceed their age-related expectations.
		</p>
					
		<h3 id="sec25" class="chapter">Suggested Pathway</h3>

		<h3 id="sec251">Year 5 Term 1</h3>

		<p>
			So here you see a suggested pathway to help the children achieve the age-related expectations by Year 5 and it’s broken down into Term 1, 2 and 3.  These are suggestions and they’re not a set way of doing it, it’s just a way that we feel can be helpful if you’re unsure what your children should be achieving at certain points through the year.  So, in Term 1, we suggested that by the end of Term 1, children should be asking for an opinion such as what’s your favourite, rather than, do you like, then moving on using those more complex structures and there’ll always be – might be able to identify information from texts that have additional information to something other than just in their topic that they’ve been learning about and the intonation and pronunciation is becoming more confident as we mentioned earlier.
		</p>

		<h3 id="sec252">Year 5 Term 2</h3>

		<p>
			In Term 2, a speaking activity that your children might be able to achieve would be re-telling a story using drama and again, this is a suggestion, it’s to change what the children are doing using different text types, rather than sticking just with presentations about themselves.  The listening activities would include listening to that wider range of classroom instructions, so rather than just the line up and put your hand up, it’s how much time do you need, for example, in sport of design and technology, and again, gradually increasing more and more and using the intonation correctly. 
		</p>

		<h3 id="sec253">Year 5 Term 3</h3>

		<p>
			So, by the end of the third term of Year 5, that’s obviously the third year of language learning, children will be able to justify their opinions using because and adding expert extra information.  They’ll also be able to give a short presentation about something based on a familiar topic, something that you’ve maybe been focusing on that term.  They will also be able to pick out the main points but for short listening text, short dialogue, short instructions and understand some of the key points and that maybe done by highlighting on a sheet or making bullet point notes about what they’ve been listening to and we’re suggesting that children, by the end of Year 5, will be able to pronounce five to ten long words accurately using the phonemes that they’re familiar with.
		</p>

		<h3 id="sec254">Year 6 Term 1</h3>

		<p>
			So, by Christmas, by the end of their first term in Year 6 or their fourth year of language learning, we’d expect them to combine a lot of the language that they’ve previously learnt, to be able to have a longer conversation – three, four, five question and answers on a topic they’ve studied.  They understand the clarification phrases and listen to slightly longer texts and all the vocabulary they’ve learned up to this point.  They can pronounce that confidently.
		</p>

		<h3 id="sec255">Year 6 Term 2</h3>

		<p>
			Around Easter-time, we’d expect them to be able to use those clarification phrases themselves and, show what you mean, what do you mean, and more regularly in the classroom as well as being able to express and justify their opinions “and we can see there…”, “I like this because…”, “but I don’t like…”, “although I love …I hate…”, you can see the range of connectors and then opinion phrases that they use at the end of their language learning experience in primary school on quite a wide range: spoken a language, different text types that they can listen and respond to and mostly pronounce their new sentences accurately.
		</p>

		<h3 id="sec256">Year 6 Term 3</h3>

		<p>
			And at the very end of their fourth year of language learning, Year 6, that we expect them to combine everything they’ve learned in those presentations where you saw an example earlier of something that they’ve built up and they can talk three to five minutes about a topic they’ve studied in which they’ve prepared over time and answer simple questions in English or the target language on it, they can understand and agree the screen with another opinion which is why we’ve put that other suggestion of following a debate because that focus, or whatever topic they’ve studied, what they think about it, exchange their points of view, agree and disagree with each other and that’s also kind of more it’ll be the listening as well, that they’ve several longer sentences and a familiar theme with some unfamiliar language.  They know key bits but also some detail and they can sustain their pronunciation and intonation for a longer period of time.  That’s the key thing, rather than just getting the key words right, they can, throughout their three to five minutes, they stay on using the right pronunciation and intonation.
		</p>
		
		<h3 id="sec26" class="chapter">Barriers and Solutions</h3>

		<h3 id="sec261">Potential Barriers for Listening</h3>

		<p>
			So we’re going to have a quick look at some of the potential barriers for listening and often this is thought to be one of the least popular skills and in primary schools, we maybe don’t do enough of giving children the opportunity to sit and listen and to understand and decode what they’ve been hearing.  So we must make sure that it doesn’t seem like a listening test for a start and to try and move away from abstract text to something that they can actually relate to.  I think what can be very helpful of the children is, that they understand that even if they don’t understand every word, they still need to concentrate and focus because they can pick up the name meaning other text by listening to key words that they do understand and thinking about context and logic as they would if they were listening to spoken text in their own language.
		</p>

		<h4 id="sec262">Teaching Ideas</h4>

		<p>
			So here are some teaching ideas, how to make listening less feel like a test or like something they pass or fail, in that they can prepare it before with their predictions, what do you think is going to be in the listening and then they could test their predictions, once they’ve listened to it, which words did you hear?  Were you right?  Obviously, they can respond physically, kinaesthetically to the text, to what they’re hearing to, so, do this action when you hear this word or answer one, a song – just to emphasise, obviously, there’s a wealth of songs out there and we’ll signpost some websites a bit later on for that.  I mean whiteboards respond by draw encircling writing and then they can see how then something we emphasise throughout, how the skills are all integrated really, it’s not just a listening standalone skill and obviously images, transcript, where you can respond, matching up words with pictures
		</p>

		<h3 id="sec263">Potential Barriers for Speaking</h3>

		<p>
			So, here are some of the potential barriers for speaking.  Obviously, the children’s cognitive levels are much more advanced than their language levels in the target language, so they need to have lots of variety in repeating the same phrases, but in lots of different ways and they need to have those opportunities on a very regular basis, so drip-feeding through the day, not waiting for a wild language lesson once every week, every fortnight, they need to be able to have the opportunity to speak and the opportunity to speak spontaneously as well in the target language.
		</p>

		<p>
			Another problem that children find with speaking, is that they can be put off by the spelling of the word, so if they’re unsure how to pronounce it, this may make them hesitate, so they obviously need to develop their confidence, not only just to have a go, but also developing their confidence with that, with the phonemes and have a better understanding of how to pronounce words.
		</p>

		<p>
			And another issue that we can sometimes encounter is our class teachers.  Sometimes they need to develop their own confidence in the target language.
		</p>

		<h3 id="sec264">Teaching Ideas</h3>

		<p>
			So here’s a range of different games and activities to break down those barriers and to make speaking a more, a really regular task and also lets the children use their relatively limited language over and over again, so they become more independent.  So a good example is, there’s Chinese whispers, things like the speed dating or those question/answer chains where you’ve got two teams competing against each other, how quickly can they pass the question and answer from one to the other, around the classroom and that also works lovely with the pass the bomb which you can – you know, that children’s party game you can buy that probably really cheaply and then pass it around and it takes the person, where it goes off, you know, and they lose a point for their team and so on.
		</p>

		<h3 id="sec27" class="chapter">Resources</h3>

		<h3 id="sec271">Suggested Resources</h3>

		<p>
			So here you can see a list of recommended websites that will not only help your pupils to develop their language skills but they’ll also give you a class teacher’s confidence, particularly if they’re unsure about pronunciation of some of the key vocabulary that they need to use.  Obviously, the BBC ones are very reliable, but a couple we can recommend here are No. 7, which has French songs and what we like about this, it’s been organised by grammar points, so you can link this very carefully to the grammar teaching of the curriculum in MFL and No. 8, this is a nice website which has French, German and Spanish songs and they’ve got a gap for the lyrics, so really useful for those listening activities and really engaging for children in upper Key Stage 2.

		<h3 id="sec28" class="chapter">Have A Go!</h3>

		<h3 id="sec281">Demonstration</h3>

		<!--    End of Listening and Speaking    -->
		
		<!--    Start of Reading    -->

		<h1 id="ch3" class="chapter">Reading</h1>

		<h2 id="sec31" class="chapter">Session Objectives</h2>

		<p>
			By the end of this session, you’ll have developed a good understanding of the age-related expectations for Year 5 and 6 in reading and by that, it’s for pupils who are in their third and fourth year of language learning.  You’ll also become confident in assessing progress in reading, using the assessment grids that we’ll be modelling later for you.  We will also be sharing some pathways to help you plan for progression across Year 5 and 6.
		</p>

		<p>
			And then, towards the end of the session, we’ll have a look at why some children find reading a difficult skill to acquire and how we can help them in overcoming that by some teaching strategies and some specific resources for reading and we’ll also showcase a few resources that are particularly good for reading whilst signposting you to some other resources as well.
		</p>

		<h2 id="sec32" class="chapter">Age Related Expectations</h2>

		<h3 id="sec321">Progression Matrix</h3>

		<p>
			So we’re going to look at progression in reading in Year 5 and 6 in a bit more detail now.  On the left of the screen in the white boxes, you can see the statutory requirements from the national curriculum.  We’ve taken these and looked at how they would develop across Year 5 and 6.  So, in Year 5, we’re expecting children to be able to start to read text with increasing grammatical complex and they can understand the main points of those.  When we talk about appreciating stories and songs and poems in the target language, we’re not expecting the children to discuss them in the target language but to read them in the target language and then to express an opinion in English.  We’re also thinking that by this point in Year 5, children feel fairly confident in looking for the meaning of an unfamiliar word, using a range of resources or strategies, for example, using dictionaries and starting to think about online dictionaries as well as paper dictionaries.
		</p>

		<p>
			And if we look at the end the fourth year of language learning, we’d expect them to move on to texts.  Obviously, there can be all sorts of texts.  We’re not talking about in short stories only, but they can cope with some unfamiliar language in more complex grammatical structures.  They will also be able to – based on their reading, they’ll be able to talk about it in, like I said, appreciate it and say why they prefer some reading to another.  That could be in English or the target language and finally, they’d be able to, instead of just sentences or phrases, to decode a text, obviously, age-appropriate using all their grammatical knowledge.
		</p>

		<h2 id="sec33" class="chapter">Year 5 Assessment</h3>

		<h3 id="sec331">Assessment Grid</h3>

		<p>
			So here you can see, the section from the assessment grids for Year 5 and we’ve highlighted the reading targets.  So by the end of Year 5, by the end of the children’s third year of language learning, they should be able to achieve these three targets in reading.
		</p>

		<h3 id="sec332">Examples</h3>

		<p>
			So once children have had the chance to read through the text and identify some of the unfamiliar words, we would anticipate that children who are working towards the age-related expectation would be able to complete an activity, such as Activity A, where they’re just stating whether statements are true or false.  Children who are working at age-related expectations, in addition to being able to complete the true or false, would be able to do an activity such as completing a table and completing whether a museum’s modern or classical, what they’re famous for and if a child is working above the age-related expectations, the additional tasks that we would hope they’d be able to complete, would be one such as identifying the museums correctly and reading the text and then putting the correct letter into the circles.  You’ll see that these activities don’t involve the children writing because they are to assess the children’s reading ability.
		</p>

		<h2 id="sec34" class="chapter">Year 6 Assessment</h2>

		<h3 id="sec341">Assessment Grid</h3>

		<p>
			So on this slide, we’ve taken the selection from the assessment grid for Year 6 and the three bullet points that relate to reading, so these are the three objectives, or that’s what children should be able to do at the end of the fourth year of language learning in Year 6.
		</p>

		<h3 id="sec342">Examples</h3>

		<p>
			So here we’ve got another example from the Mary Glasgow magazines, so interview with a skier and again, you can see the different type of text, interview, non-fiction for a magazine, lots of cognates and also a glossary at the bottom for some words that their children wouldn’t have learned in class.
		</p>

		<p>
			So here’s the task to go with the interview with the skier and you can see, and when children are working towards the age-related expectations, they will be able to fill in the basic information, French and English or English with some inaccuracies on an expected level when they meet their expectations, they would be able to fill in most of the information showing a good understanding, still with a few mistakes, obviously, and then if they were above the age-related expectations, you would expect them to fill in pretty much all the information accurately.  As an extension, you could think to show their understanding of the text, they could talk about how does the skier feel when he wins, based on what you’ve read about it, or similar question that they answer in English.
		</p>
					
		<h3 id="sec35" class="chapter">Suggested Pathway</h3>

		<h3 id="sec351">Year 5 Term 1</h3>

		<p>
			In order to help you plan to help children achieve the age-related expectations by the end of year 5, we’ve created some suggested pathways that go term by term.  So, for example, by the end of Term 1 in Year 5, children will be reading a wide range of materials but would suggest that if you need interviews, such as the ones we’ve shown from the Mary Glasgow magazines, that type of thing and a range of authentic non-fiction tests, so that might include menus from restaurants and things like that.  Children will be able to respond in English, expressing their own opinions in English and then continue to develop their vocabulary and they’re recognising words across a range of context.
		</p>

		<h3 id="sec352">Year 5 Term 2</h3>

		<p>
			So, by the end of Term 2, children should have had the opportunity to read a wide range of fiction text and they should have the opportunity to choose from a range of texts that you have available in the classroom.  They will be able to respond but we’re using opinions, again in English and complete true/false activities.  They’ll gradually increase their vocabulary, including things such as negatives, adjectives and questions. 
		</p>

		<h3 id="sec353">Year 5 Term 3</h3>

		<p>
			So, by the end of Term 3 in Year 5, so that’s like children’s third year of language learning, they will be selecting books and choosing books with unfamiliar language because they’ll have developed the confidence to decode that language, using cues that they would be using when reading in English but also they’ll be able to select the most useful resources to help them to find out unfamiliar language such as online dictionaries, or using books, or using their own word books that they’ve been creating.
		</p>

		<h3 id="sec354">Year 6 Term 1</h3>

		<p>
			So, from the same for Year 6, in their last year of language learning in primary school, we’ve developed this – the suggested pathways and so by Christmas in their last year of language learning, they would be able to access a wide range of texts, further develop their answers in French.  They show an understanding of present and future tenses in the text when they can answer questions relating to that and they use the more standard dictionaries, rather than address through their own word lists to look up words and they can also, in a text, look at the different structures and the tenses and the adjectives.
		</p>

		<h3 id="sec355">Year 6 Term 2</h3>

		<p>
			So by the Easter time, in the their last year, you can see what they’re supposed to achieve and also you can see the link to grammar as the grammar enables them to access those more complicated texts and to make meaning out of them.  So, you can see – and they can also think, like, writing questions for a partner, so they show coming up with the questions for a text, well surely they’ve understood the text.  They use the more sophisticated dictionary or they’re quicker at accessing words and they can talk about why they prefer certain materials to others.
		</p>

		<h3 id="sec356">Year 6 Term 3</h3>

		<p>
			And towards the end of their fourth year of language learning in primary school, they’re fully developed, being able to access a wide range of text types, they can cope with a good amount of unfamiliar language, depending on the ability of the child, but they’ve got a range of tools and strategies to find out meanings, to make meanings.  They would be exposed to using a thesaurus to expand their vocabulary based on their reading materials, looking at why certain word choices were made, what other word choices could have been made and what that means.  That obviously is closely linked to their grammatical understanding of a text and they can link, that’s obviously very integrated with their writing and their speaking and they can use that vocabulary also actively.
		</p>

		
		<h3 id="sec36" class="chapter">Barriers and Solutions</h3>

		<h3 id="sec361">Potential Barriers for Reading</h3>

		<p>
			So some of the potential barriers for reading are firstly that children can feel a little bit nervous when they’re faced with a text in the foreign language and so it’s important that that gets broken down for them and they’re given the confidence to have a go with that.  It also can be difficult to find texts that are age-appropriate because, of course, their cognitive level of understanding will be far higher than their ability to read the text in the target language.  Also, we need to make sure that children develop the reading techniques that they’ve been developing in English to ensure that they can understand the texts and progress in that target language.  Also, often in primary language, we put a lot of emphasis on the speaking and listening and we need to make sure that we do have the opportunities for reading on a regular basis.
		</p>

		<h4 id="sec362">Teaching Ideas 1</h4>

		<p>
			So developing children’s reading skills in the target language goes hand in hand with developing their reading skills in English and so you’ll be using all the same techniques that you do for teaching reaching and English, so using a range of strategies, such as, reading in a group, partner reading, individual reading and then having chosen text with the focused learning activities and we can find a lot of really good examples of that in the Mary Glasgow magazines, but obviously there are other examples and you can create your own.  It’s also important to have a wide range of reading materials available for the children you can see here, not just stories, but poems, songs, magazines, comics, things that are appropriate for the children to make sure that they are wanting to choose the books and they are feeling that they’re reading them for interest and enjoyment and we’ve often found that children do go in certain – because even if they’re not familiar with all the vocabulary, if those books are engaging for them.
		</p>

		<p>
			Also, again, as I said earlier, you’re looking at using the reading strategies so the children are decoding, they’re looking for clues, for example, in the illustrations, in the context of the book which will enable them to decode the meaning, without necessarily having to stop to look for every single new piece of vocabulary.  Also, to enable the children to access the text, then they will need that support in using glossaries, word lists and dictionaries, so that they can feel independent when they take a text with unfamiliar language in.
		</p>

		<h4 id="sec363">Teaching Ideas 2</h4>

		<p>
			So we’ve put together some teaching ideas here, to try and break down those barriers to reading.  They’ve obviously also seen it from word searches, crosswords, on a more basic level, on a word level, if you’re really looking at that.  Rebuilding a text, matching images with texts and then obviously multiple choice questions, surveys, those kind of things and also reading tasks, writing questions for someone else to read and you can see how reading is, like all the other skills, is not a standalone skill that you can just teach separately, it does all link with the speaking, listening and writing and we’ve given some examples of reading – they’ve written something as apart from them doing a writing task on and also to do a speaking task in the same way.
		</p>

		<h3 id="sec37" class="chapter">Resources</h3>

		<h3 id="sec371">Suggested Resources</h3>

		<p>
			So we’ve put together a list of some recommended websites that you can use and, again, you’ll see there, the Mary Glasgow publications which we really highly recommend.  So, although that’s a paid for resource, one suggestion would be to either see if your partner secondary school has some old issues that you could borrow, because they would last you a long time with the material in them, or indeed, work with a cluster of schools to get a subscription.  Another company that we like is the European School Books, because they have a really wide range of very engaging and appealing high quality text that would be very useful to start building up a library in your target language.  You can see also the Northern Ireland curriculum has some very good activities and games to develop primary languages.
		</p>

		<p>
			And here you can see some examples for supporting reading, although a lot of these are song-based or speaking-based, they have the text on the screen, so it’s, I suppose, a bit like a karaoke-style, so the children, as well as hearing the vocabulary, they’re actually seeing the written word at the same time, so that’s really useful for you.
		</p>

		<h3 id="sec38" class="chapter">Have A Go!</h3>

		<h3 id="sec381">Demonstration</h3>

		<p>
			Here, a French example, the Bonjour de France, is, when you look at it, it looks more like a website for secondary, for higher levels, but there is actually a lot of material that is highly accessible for primary children to use and you can see here, something cross-curricular, so it actually doesn’t need much language, it ties in very well with maths and just losing a lot of cognates to apply that in another curriculum area.

			Again, yabla is similar in that you can pay and subscribe to it, there are some free clips available and as you can see, you play it, and it’s subtitled in both languages.  You can select and switch on and off and then you can play again by where it plays and it pauses the dialogue or the phone conversation and you have to type in the word, so it is kind of a mixed reading and writing activity.

		<h2 id="sec41" class="chapter">Session Objectives</h2>

		<p>
			In this session, we’re going to be focusing on the age-related expectations for Year 5 and 6 in writing and this is for children who are in their third and fourth year of sustained language learning.  So, although some of the age-related expectations might seem a little bit high, we’re going to talk you through how you could help the children achieve those, building on the work that they will have done already in Year 3 and 4.  We’ll also be looking in details at the assessment grid, so you can see how you can assess the writing progress and then we’ve developed some pathways to enable you to make plan for progress across Year 5 and 6, across each term.
		</p>

		<p>
			And we’ll finish the session by looking at the problems that children could experience and that could put them off writing and obviously how to overcome those by a range of different approaches and practical teaching tips and finally we’ll look at a range of different resources that could help you in supporting the children in their writing progress and we’ll demonstrate one resource in a bit more detail.
		</p>

		<h2 id="sec42" class="chapter">Age Related Expectations</h2>

		<h3 id="sec421">Progression Matrix</h3>

		<p>
			So here you can see the progression matrix for Year 5 and 6.  You can see the statutory requirements in the white boxes on the left hand side of the government expectations for children by the end of Year 5 and 6 in language learning.  So by the end of Year 5, children are starting to write longer compound sentences and they’re beginning to adapt sentences and short texts, often with support, but beginning to make changes, depending on the topic that you’re doing.
		</p>

		<p>
			By the end of their language learning experience, you can see in the writing, it’s hard to separate out from the grammar, obviously, because they’ll showcase their grammatical knowledge and accuracy through their writing more than anything.  Well, and their speaking, sorry, and you can see them moving to complex sentences, to paragraphs that could come from work they’ve written over the course of the year and covers topics they’ve done in Year 3, 4 and 5 as well.  So, kind of, everything comes together at the end of Key Stage 2 that they can produce a longer extended text and like a piece of writing and they obviously need all their grammatical knowledge to produce that with accuracy and also a dictionary or online tool to extend their vocabulary independently.
		</p>

		<h2 id="sec43" class="chapter">Year 5 Assessment</h3>

		<h3 id="sec431">Assessment Grid</h3>

		<p>
			So here you can see the assessment grids for writing in Year 5.  If the children manage to meet all the objectives that you can see here, then they have reached the age-related expectations for Year 5.
		</p>

		<h3 id="sec432">Example</h3>

		<p>
			So here you can see a transcript of what writing might look like by the end of Year 5 and something like this, which is a script for doing a weather report, so it may be something that they’ve prepared a script for ready to film.  It’s something that the children will have been working on for a number of weeks.  It’s not expected that children sit down and take a test at the end of Year 5 and produce something like this.  It would have been a topic to do with weather, looking at the vocabulary for weather, looking at certain phrases and sentences and then children should be able to produce this in the target language and, again, they’ll be using the tool, such as dictionaries and you may have a glossary for them to use as well and some children may need further support with writing frames.
		</p>  

		<h2 id="sec44" class="chapter">Year 6 Assessment</h2>

		<h3 id="sec441">Assessment Grid</h3>

		<p>
			Here you see the section on writing taken from the Year 6 assessment grid and, again, if the children have met those four bullet points and show that in their writing, then they’ve met the age-related expectations for Year 6.
		</p>

		<h3 id="sec442">Example</h3>

		<p>
			So here is an example of a piece of writing that the student would produce at the end of Year 6 and I know that, from feedback we’ve had from delivering this course and from colleagues, that at first glance, this looks quite a daunting prospect to you for children to write this.  If we break this down and look at the sentences, so you can see the first sentence, or the first two sentences, they will have produced that regularly in Year 3 and Year 4 and you can see throughout, there’s bits, like, I really like P.E, I play football, I don’t like history, so you can see those sentences are taking – they’ll have had plenty of practice in their first couple of years of language learning.  My favour flavour pizza is cheese and then also there’s obviously a lot of phrases and adverbs and then structures that are from Year 4 or 5 and Year 6.  And we wouldn’t, again, expect the children to produce this in a test in the hall in exam conditions, like they would do for GCSE, it’s produced over the course of Year 6, it draws on previous knowledge.  They don’t write the whole thing in one go, but over the course of Year 6, by the end of Year 6, they should have produced something like this on the topics they have covered throughout their Key Stage 2 language experience.
		</p>

				
		<h3 id="sec45" class="chapter">Suggested Pathway</h3>

		<h3 id="sec451">Year 5</h3>

		<p>
			Here you can see a suggested pathway that we’ve developed to help children make the required progress in Year 5.  I must stress, this is a suggested path, when it will obviously depend on the topics you’re teaching and the progress that your children are making, but we feel there needs to be a big focus in Year 5 on children developing their understanding of the connectives, basic connectives, to enable them to write compound sentences by the end of Term 3.  In Term 1 and 2 also, from the beginning, to make sure adaptations to longer text and these need to be across a range of text types.  So, for example, we’ve said here, recipes, weather reports, poems, anything obviously that’s interesting for your children, that gives them that wider opportunity for writing and so by the end of Term 3, they can adapt and edit text and they can also include additional information using the knowledge that they have got in vocabulary on the topic that you’re doing, and gradually they’re building on their use of a dictionary to help them in spelling unfamiliar words.
		</p>

		<h3 id="sec452">Year 6</h3>

		<p>
			So you can see here the overview we’ve put together for your children to be able to reach their age-related expectations by the end of Year 6, broken down over the three terms and you can see, again, how it’s really impossible to separate out from the grammar in that supports the structure and the accuracy in their writing.
		</p>

		<p>
			Now, you can see how we extend the connectives to then put together a simple text but using complex sentences and then over the course of the year, they would have produced several pieces, on a theme or with connected themes that would then result in that piece we looked at earlier and you can see there are several previously written short texts, produce a portfolio of work and we, again, can’t emphasise enough, it’s not in exam conditions with no help whatsoever.  They obviously will use the dictionary and glossary independently to extend their vocabulary and increase their accuracy and spelling as well.
		</p>

	
		<h3 id="sec46" class="chapter">Barriers and Solutions</h3>

		<h3 id="sec461">Potential Barriers for Writing</h3>

		<p>
			So here we’re going to look at some of the potential barriers for writing and although, hopefully, by Year 5 and 6, children are developing a fair amount of confidence at writing, there’s still a mismatch between the cognitive and the linguistic level for the children.  Hopefully, as well, children are becoming more confident about writing, so they’re less worried about making mistakes than they may have been in Year 3 and 4, but obviously as the level that your expecting increases, children are still going to be nervous of possible spellings, endings, word order.  Another issue for writing in year 5 and 6 can be the teacher’s confidence because if they’re nervous of the target language and they don’t have a lot of subject knowledge in it, this can lead to them feeling less confident in teaching writing, so they may, in some cases, try to do more speaking, listening activities, but it’s really important that the children do have those opportunities to write really at every opportunity and integrated with the other skills of speaking and listening in order for them to make progress across the whole of the MFL curriculum and it’s really important, even more so, I would say, as the children get into Year 5 and 6, that they have the opportunities for writing for a real purpose, real audience.  Things, for example, that you may consider there would be developing a link for the school in the country where the target language is spoken.
		</p>

		<h4 id="sec462">Teaching Ideas - Approach</h4>

		<p>
			So here are some approaches to teaching writing and you can see that they’re very similar to the approaches that you would have to teach in English.  So, giving the children a lot of opportunities for writing, hopefully, that they’re in a rich language environment where things in the classroom are labelled, so they have the opportunity to see the vocabulary that they are going to be writing, that children have the opportunity to have a go at writing without feeling nervous about it, so lots of opportunities on white boards, for example, just to get ideas down and that they do write across the curriculum, for example, in terms of Design & Technology, they may write a book, a pop-out book for example, or they get the opportunity to write recipes.  Obviously topics that will be interesting for the children will include things such as sport as well, so writing across a whole range of topics, and ensuring that the children do have those opportunities to write about things that they’ve been doing, hobbies, their own hobbies, things that they’ve been doing at the weekend.
		</p>

		<h4 id="sec463">Teaching Ideas - Practical Tips</h4>

		<p>
			So here we’ve put together a list of practical teaching ideas, how you could try and break down those barriers and that the students have a really wide range of writing tasks and activities, so it doesn’t feel repetitive with the language that they’ve learnt.  So, I’ll just pick out a couple of examples there.
		</p>

		<p>
			At the top, you can see the snowball.  The snowball activity works as follows.  So you have, like, a writing frame, or three or four sentences on the board.  If they’re towards the end of Key Stage 2, in Year 6, it might just be that you tell them what to write, kind of translation style, so there could be future tense, In 20 years, I will live in, right, put a city, and I will be a friend of, I will own a, so it could be as, depending on the level of language and where you’re using it, quite a free activity, or still very structured and then after your sentence, the students scrunch up their piece of paper, throw it at a dedicated place in the classroom, not the teacher, and then pick up a new piece, write the next sentence, so they produce a paragraph, but it’s collaboratively, not on their own.  Obviously pattern poems have all – look at some examples in a bit.  You can see the diamond line, they’re ranking activities, so that could be done with sentences now at the end of Key Stage 2 instead of just words – statements that they ran from the most – the least important and they can talk about it, could lead to a speaking activity or you could give them a diamond line filled in and they say, why, that’s the most important, or I agree/disagree with it in writing.
		</p>

		<p>
			And then the final example I’d like to pick out is the little stick man at the bottom and you can – the character they might have created in Year 3 or Year 4 with their basic descriptions, they could now interact, be part of a story.  They could go on an adventure, travel somewhere and, again, try to link that with other curriculum areas, makes that a lot more powerful than just confining it to the foreign language lesson.
		</p>

		<h4 id="sec464">Examples</h4>

		<p>
			So here is an example of what the snowball writing could be made up of.  So, you can see the different sentences but it could be past tense, it could be future tense, you could focus on the grammar, you could just give them the first word, or you could write that for another person, then he or she will do these things, or has done these things.  So loads of ways of changing that and making that suit your class.
		</p>

		<p>
			Here is an example from an American artist who does that for a living, you can do that with the children. So black-out poetry, you give him the text of target language, still in Key Stage 2, and even Key Stage 3, I would say, if you give them an authentic piece of newspaper article, it’s way beyond their linguistic level.  However, they can use that as a stimulus for writing in that they can look for the words that they know, so it could be on an article on a topic that you’ve studied with them, so they should be able to pick out – they know all the transferable vocab, the modal verbs and it and she and the words that come up loads, they’re simple connectives and maybe some topical vocabulary and then try and make meaning with that, so it’s a combined reading and writing task.  The output is a poem, so it is writing in that sense, but it might be quite a fun and different way of doing writing.
		</p>

		<p>
			And you can see a range of pattern and shape poems with language.  Others like to focus on the cat.  As you can see, that is made up of different sentences that would normally make a paragraph, but especially when you write a description or if you’re thinking of recipes, or weather forecasts, it could be in the shape of the weather map in the shape of a dish or something and you can see the cross-curricular links that you could use in other visual stimulus as well as a written one and combine the two.
		</p>

		<p>
			A final example for writing is then, those wanted letters which could now be written as paragraphs rather than as maybe the bullet point on key words that you would have produced in Year 3, if you’d done that task and then again, use it as a reading stimulus or as a discussion starting point about who do you think does this, who would – you could use that kind of language instead of just find the person who has brown eyes and so on.
		</p>

		<h3 id="sec47" class="chapter">Resources</h3>

		<h3 id="sec471">Suggested Resources</h3>

		<p>
			So now you can see, we’ve put a list of suggested websites that will help to support writing in Key Stage 2.  You can see that we’ve suggested here, ‘tagxedo’ and ‘wordle’– with these you can create word plans and maybe that you give the children a word plan that you’ve already created and they take that and then they do the writing sentences based on the stimulus of the words that we put into that, it could be that they put sentences or poems into their own word shapes using that, so quite a lot of ways to use that to support writing in Key Stage 2.
		</p>

		<p>
			Other activities that we recommend are things that such as ‘Comic Life’ and ‘toondoo’ so the children create stories using cartoon strips, so they don’t feel daunted by having to do huge pages of writing, they’re able to break the writing down into smaller chunks, but building up over time to get in those complex sentences that you’re looking for by the end of Year 6.
		</p>

		<h3 id="sec48" class="chapter">Have A Go!</h3>

		<h3 id="sec481">Demonstration</h3>

		<p>
			So the one resource we’d like to demonstrate in a bit more detail is Storybirds.  It’s an online picture book creator with using professional artists.  It’s all for free.  There are add-ons that you can then pay for.  So, for example, you can create a book online, if you wanted to download and print it, you have to pay, you know, purchase the book which doesn’t cost much but there is a cost involved but you get a free teacher’s account and then you can create classes, I think, up to 30 students for free which is plenty for what you need and then you can also, once those children have written their books, they can peer assess them, which I’ll show on one of the next slides.
		</p>

		<p>
			So once you get Storybird, you can see, you can do a search for artwork, a keyword search, or you can look by artist if you like a particular style.  So if you type in animals or something, it’ll pull all the different pictures of animals into, like, a writing dashboard as you can see on the screen and then you can drag pictures across and then type your text in the white space down at the bottom of the screen.  But there’s also lots of different layouts available.
		</p>

		<p>
			So once the students are finished and published their book, you can embed this on a blog or a website and there’s an example of how we’ve used that in my school, but you can also use the – just stay within Storybirds and students can – there’s a class library tab that students can then peer assess to choose stars as they wish.  So after they’ve written something, it could be a really nice reading stimulus, or stimulus for further writing afterwards, in that they can write the review or express what they think about it in the target language.
		</p>

		<!--    End of Writing   -->

		<!--    Start of Grammar    -->

		<h1 id="ch5" class="chapter">Grammar</h1>

		<h2 id="sec51" class="chapter">Session Objectives</h2>

		<p>
			In this session we’re going to be focussing on the age-related expectations for Year 5 and 6 in grammar, so that’s in children’s third and fourth year of language learning.  We’re going to look at the assessment grids in more detail, so that you feel confident in assessing the progress that children have made in grammar and we’re going to be looking at some suggested pathways that would help you plan for progression across Year 5 and 6.
		</p>

		<p>
			We’re also going to look at why some, and indeed, some staff, struggle with grammar, the teaching and learning side of grammar and we look at the range of teaching ideas, how to combat that and help them overcome it and we’ll finish the session by looking at a range of resources around grammar and we’ll showcase one resource in more detail.
		</p>

		<h2 id="sec52" class="chapter">Age Related Expectations</h2>

		<h3 id="sec521">Progression Matrix</h3>

		<p>
			We’re now going to look in more detail at the progression matrix.  On the left hand side, you can see the statutory requirements for languages at Key Stage 2 and then you can see that broken down into Year 5 and Year 6.  So starting off with the nouns, pronouns, articles and adjectives, you’ll see that in Year 5, children should ideally be able to use adjectives increasingly correctly, in terms of the verb endings and moving into Year 6, they move on to adverbs, and also their understanding about how politeness is conveyed by different forms of language in different target languages.
		</p>

		<p>
			In terms of verbs, children obviously have been looking at the regular verbs in Year 3 and 4 and they’re moving on to conjugating, simple irregular verbs.  They also are able to now start putting negatives into simple sentences.
		</p>

		<p>
			By the end of Year 6, children should be using modem verbs and also starting to recognise the past tense and once this may sound daunting, often children are quite confident when they’re give the structure to use that structure without having to have full knowledge of the whole range of verb endings for the whole of the past tense and children then are beginning to use negative sentences fairly consistently and accurately.
		</p>

		<p>
			So, on this slide, you can see their progression between Year 5 and Year 6 and we look at key features and patterns of language, so especially word order and then how they apply their knowledge of – how words are – the order they come in a sentence, in a question, in a statement and also where words go and how words are shaped to convey future or past intent and then from their understanding to actually producing an orally written piece accurately using three to five key grammatical features without making too many mistakes and it’s understandable so we look at their word order feature intent question formation connectives.
		</p>

		<p>
			The second part of that is also that they’re understanding prefixes, suffixes and how these common letter strings, in English and other languages, can help them extend their vocabulary as they carry meaning and then they use that knowledge to understand and explain the key features in the text.
		</p>

		<h2 id="sec53" class="chapter">Year 5 Assessment</h3>

		<h3 id="sec531">Assessment Grid</h3>

		<p>
			So here you can see the grammar section from the assessment grid for Year 5.  And again, quite a long list of expectations here for the children by the end of Year 5, but hopefully this will be building up in the work that they’ve been doing through Year 3 and 4.   We’re going to take a look in a moment at how you’ll be able to assess that through a range of activities you’ll be doing anyway in the classroom with the children.
		</p>

		<p>
			So in order to assess grammar in Year 5.  We’re not looking at standalone tests, grammar tests, and grammar exams for children, we’re looking to assess their grammar through the work that they’re doing in writing, reading, speaking, listening.  So here you can see an exemplification of an assessment activity in Year 5, the transcript of that, of what a child, by the end of Year 5 should hopefully be able to do, in terms of their writing and you’ll be able to see the grammatical structures that they can use in this and how you can use those against the assessment grids to see where the children have achieved the grammar expectations through their written work.
		</p>

		<p>
			And moving on to looking at assessing grammar through speaking and listening, you can see some transcripts here of expectations for the end of Year 5 in speaking and listening and, again, if children are able to use this vocabulary correctly in speaking and listening exercises, then, very clearly, you can see that they can meet the grammar expectations for Year 5.
		</p>

		<p>
			So we’re looking back here to the assessment activity for reading in Year 5 and we’re seeing how this can be used to help us assess grammar without doing a separate grammar activity.   For the children to be able to do the reading assessment here, to read this text and do the activities that accompany this text, they need to have a good understanding of the grammar structures which you can see in the text here, so you’d be able to assess children’s understanding of the grammar expectations at Year 5 through their ability to do this reading activity.
		</p>

		<h2 id="sec54" class="chapter">Year 6 Assessment</h2>

		<h3 id="sec541">Assessment Grid</h3>

		<p>
			Here, we’ve extracted a section under grammar taken from the Year 6 assessment grid and, as before, it does look quite a daunting long list.  Many bullet points compared to the other skills.  However, as we try to show in this session, you are assessing this through every task that you do in the classroom and especially through their regular other skills, listening, reading, writing, and speaking.  You can tick off many of those bullet points in one task and it might be an idea to have a copy of that next to you as you look at the next slides.
		</p>  

		<h3 id="sec542">Example</h3>

		<p>
			This is the assessment we’ve put together.  A sample assessment for speaking, for the end of Key Stage 2 and you can see the first two levels they’re merging and they’re expected and in red you can see how the grammar ties in with that, with opinions, negatives, longer sentences.
		</p>

		<p>
			Here’s the exceeding level.  Just to reassure you, we wouldn’t imagine this to be produced as a speech in test conditions, but again, this draws from all the learning they’ve done in Key Stage 2 is being put together over time and are presented with some support with this visual or some key words or sentence starters, but again, you can see how it covers all the grammar points that they’re expected to have mastered by the end of Key Stage 2.
		</p>

		<p>
			Here is the reading stimulus for the sample assessment Year 6 and as you will see in the next slide, to be able to access the key information and do the exercises, the students automatically demonstrate a high level of competency in terms of their grammar skills.
		</p>

		<p>
			So once students have completed the reading side of this task, it can be used as a springboard to then have a discussion about the grammar or asking some follow-up grammar questions and you can see they might have demonstrated that, in they can move from the first to the third person by saying, well Kevin thinks this and that about his fans and he thinks this using the first person.
		</p>

		<p>
			The final assessment example we’re looking at is the writing task and to reiterate that this is the task not produced in exam conditions but the task covering loads of language familiar from Year 3, 4 and 5 and 6 and on familiar topics put together over the course of a few months or even a couple of terms and then being put together like a portfolio of work and then you can see, you should be able to produce this in French, Spanish or German, or your chosen type of language that students will demonstrate a very good level of grammatical understanding and accuracy.
		</p>

			
		<h3 id="sec55" class="chapter">Suggested Pathway</h3>

		<h3 id="sec551">Year 5 Term 1</h3>

		<p>
			So here, we’re going to look at some suggested pathways for teaching grammar through Year 5.  So by the end of Term 1, we’re looking at children being able to use adjectives correctly and also being able to spot patterns in regular verbs.  They’ll have a range of question words that they can use and they’ll also be able to form a negative sentence in the first, second and third person.
		</p>

		<h3 id="sec552">Year 5 Term 2</h3>

		<p>
			By the end of Term 2 in year 5, children will be able to apply the patterns that they’ve learnt about in regular verbs and use this to new verbs.  They’ll also be able to start conjugating some common irregular verbs.  In addition to this, they’re going to be using ways to express negation and also they’ll recognise future tense.  They won’t be necessarily using the future tense but they will recognise the format of it and how to use that in a simple way. 
		</p>

		<h3 id="sec553">Year 5 Term 3</h3>

		<p>
			So by the end of Year 5, children should be using up to three to five adjectives correctly, in terms of word order and ending but become increasingly confident with verbs, particularly those regular verbs where they can identify verb endings and use those in a range of context and they’ll start to feel more confident with the common irregular verbs as well.  And moving towards the understanding of the future tense and how it can be formed – not necessarily being able to do it, but realising certain patterns form that future intent.
		</p>

		<h3 id="sec554">Year 6 Term 1</h3>

		<p>
			In Year 6, we’re looking at putting that grammatical knowledge to greater accurate use, so you can see they extended their conjugation of present tense verbs but also putting that in a descriptive context.  Their future plans with fluency in using the future tense and they can use negative tenses correctly to communicate, not just picking it out in reading or a listening task.
		</p>

		<h3 id="sec555">Year 6 Term 2</h3>

		<p>
			In Term 2, Year 6, we’re covering adverbs, adjectives in greater depth.  We’re looking at present feature tense.  We’re starting to look for patterns in the past tense sentences, not using it, but spotting it in a text and then how – what similarities they can see and we can see not just a negative, not a sentence, but also other forms of expressing a negation.
		</p>

		<h3 id="sec556">Year 6 Term 3</h3>

		<p>
			So, by the end of Key Stage 2, in their last term of year 6, they can understand and use a wide range of adjectives, adverbs.  They can use the present and future tense, some past tense in the fixed phrases or key verbs, like was and had and they can spot the past tense when it’s used and the standard, using their verb knowledge and can also use a number of verbs in a condition I would like, I could do this or I should do this – can fix phrases without going too much into the underlying grammar.
		</p>

		
		<h3 id="sec56" class="chapter">Barriers and Solutions</h3>

		<h3 id="sec561">Potential Barriers for Grammar</h3>

		<p>
			So here we’re going to take a look at some of the potential barriers for teaching grammar and ways to overcome these barriers.  So, one of the main problems of teaching grammar is that staff don’t always have the confidence to teach grammar in a language that they’re not really familiar with, so we do need to give staff the confidence in teaching grammar with the target language and to also help staff teach the rules for grammar and how to deal with exceptions to the rules.  Things that we need to do, to make sure the grammar is taught effectively, is to ensure that it’s taught across all of the different strands, so taught in writing, reading, speaking, listening and the grammar points are made explicit, especially as the demands for grammar have been raised in your curriculum.  We also need to make sure that the grammar is purposeful and relevant, so we need to find ways of making the grammar activities interesting for our children.
		</p>

		<h4 id="sec562">Teaching Ideas</h4>

		<p>
			We’ve put together a range of teaching ideas and activities, all based around grammar and just to highlight some of those in a bit more detail, so it obviously starts with the more regular highlighting, colour-coding things in the text, post-it notes and then you could that as a base for activities, like a relay race, so, say, put them in teams and then give them all the first task, that they find five adjectives.  Okay, as soon as you’ve found them, bring them back and you get the next task.  Okay, now find the true negative sentences.  Okay, find the past tense phrase, so it’s covering a wide number of grammar points with a quite complicated text potentially which is looking for detail, looking for those grammar structures they’ve just been learning about.  Other activities – they come up with their own song, Dan’s Rap, whatever it is, is supposed to develop – remember the rule and also due when the rule doesn’t apply for those exceptions and then use that to teach each other and a final activity I wanted to talk about is when you give students grammar categories in groups.  Let’s say you, five students you, the masculine you, feminine you, past, future, present tense and you read out a series of statements or you read through a text and as the students hear or notice their allocated grammar point, they perform a certain action or make a noise or stand up, or write them down to make it more interactive.
		</p>


		<h3 id="sec57" class="chapter">Resources</h3>

		<h3 id="sec571">Suggested Resources</h3>

		<p>
			Here you can see a selection of resources all to do with grammar.  I’d like to highlight No. 3, the French song database which is excellent if you’re looking for songs around a certain grammar point and that’s something that’s very hard to find and songs obviously where to engage the children.  Obviously, the songs might often be too difficult on a linguistic level, in terms of understanding what the song’s about, but you could just summarise the song for them and then just do some games activities around the grammar point that is in that song, by giving them a transcript or having a gap-fill exercise by having them, like I said before, perform an action when they hear the grammar point in the song and eventually learning the song and some accurate templates for that grammar point.  For Spanish, there is a wealth of songs on You Tube where teachers, especially from Latin America, have worked with their classes to produce a rap or a song, often based on current hits in the charts and using a grammar point to teach it and that might be an excellent activity then as well, for yourselves to do with your children once you’ve watched a couple of those to come up with your own song and upload that.
