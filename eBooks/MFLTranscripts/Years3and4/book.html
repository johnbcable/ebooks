		<h1 id="ch1" class="chapter">Introduction</h1>

		<p>
			This ebook is one of two which contain transcripts of the online lectures provided as part of the Modern Foreign Languages Programme jointly provided online by the <a href="http://warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/cpe/">Centre for Professional Education at the University of Warwick</a>, <a href="http://vle.thw.coventry.sch.uk/web/">Tile Hill Wood School &amp; Language College</a> and <a href="http://howesprimary.co.uk">Howes Primary School</a>. Grant funding was provided by the Department for Education to develop CPD courses for MFL Primary school teachers. 
		</p>
		<p>
			This book is organised in sequence with the structure of the online Primary MFL CPD course It covers information for teaching years 3 &amp; 4 in relation to listening &amp; speaking; reading; writing and grammar. A second volume of transcripts covers equivalent sections for teaching years 5 &amp; 6.

		<h1 id="ch2" class="chapter">Listening &amp; Speaking</h1>

		<h2 id="sec21" class="chapter">Session Objectives</h2>

		<p>
			So, by the end of this session, you will have developed a clear understanding of the age-related expectations for Year 3 and 4, in speaking, listening, and when we refer to Year 3 and 4, we’re talking about the first and second year of language learning.  By the end of this session, you’ll also feel confident in assessing progress and speaking and listening by using the assessment grids which will be shown later in the session.  But also, hopefully feel more confident in planning for progression, we will have some sample pathways that you can look at to give you an idea how you can build progression throughout Year 3 and 4, building on those small steps to enable the children to reach those age-related expectations at the end of the year.
		</p>

		<p>
			And the other two things we’ll look at, is firstly, we’ll have a look and discuss how – what could block progress in listening and speaking specifically and also at specific teaching ideas and strategies, how to overcome them and the final thing we’ll look at is, we’ll signpost you to a range of resources and we’ll showcase, demonstrate one of them in a bit more detail.
		</p>

		<h2 id="sec22" class="chapter">Age Related Expectations</h2>

		<h3 id="sec221">Progression Matrix</h3>

		<p>
			So we’re now going to focus on the age-related expectations for speaking and listening.  In the white box, you can see the DfE statutory requirements for the end of Key Stage 2.  Children should be able to listen and respond spoken language.  In Year 3, this would very much be linked to language, linked to the families, greetings, introductions, moving on to topics and themes in Year 4, for example, food or sport.  In Year 3, children will be able to listen to a range of very simple classroom instruction, such as, put your hands up, sit down, listen and repeat.  By the time they’re moving to the end of Year 4, you’d be expecting them to be able to understand instructions of increasing complexity, such as, talk to your partner, your turn now and gradually being able to listen to extended instructions and following those instructions.
		</p>

		<p>
			Right, and moving on to speaking.  So we’re looking at conversations, asking/answering questions, opinions and in Year 3, sort of, in their first year, we’d expect them to be able to have the generic introductions about, my name is, what is your name, how old are you, give their age and then just expanding their vocabulary towards the end of their second year of language learning, and having a wider range of phrases, so a good example is, that opinions, when they start off with just saying, I like, I don’t like, but then they have a wider range they can have more shades of expressing their opinion from, I love, I like, I really love to, I dislike, I hate certain things and they also make progress in being able to ask for, can you repeat that please, can you speak more slowly, moving on from their first year of language learning where they just say, I don’t understand or communicate that in different ways.
		</p>

		<p>
			So in this slide, we’re looking at the pronunciation and phonics and the great thing is, obviously, the children have a wealth of experience in learning English and using phonics when they learnt to read and write and so it’s applying that knowledge and their skills on to their new language which should give them quite a lot of confidence and we’ve put – you can see, a benchmark there, 20 words at the end of their first year, they can pronounce accurately and if you think of the examples we gave in the previous two slides and the conversations, the question/answers that easily is already 20 words.  You’re not thinking of 20 – like a list of nouns, it’s those conversations, like words in context meaning.  And obviously then in the second year of language learning, we’d expect them to then be able to pronounce some new words using their phonic knowledge that they’ve acquired, but the rules of pronunciation in the second language and also have a better understanding of intonation and using that when they speak themselves.
		</p>

		<p>
			Another of the age-related expectations in MFL is for the children to be able to present ideas and information orally.  By the end of Year 3, children should be able to introduce themselves, say how old they are.  It’s very simple things in word and phrase and they should also be able to participate in a song within the group setting, so not by themselves, they’re not expected to perform by themselves.  Moving into Year 4, where they’d be able to talk a little bit more about themselves, for example, about their family, about pets and using the new vocabulary for likes and dislikes and they’d be able to give some simple instructions, and again, using the classroom instructions that you’ve been developing with them, so not a whole new range of different instructions.
		</p>

		<h2 id="sec23" class="chapter">Year 3 Assessment</h3>

		<h3 id="sec231">Assessment Grid</h3>

		<p>
			This is the speaking and listening section taken from the Year 3 assessment grid and by the end, it links to the matrix that we’ve put together, that we’ve discussed in the previous slides and the list of statements, hopefully, a class teacher would be able to tick and say that each child in their class has achieved the majority of their statements and it’s designed so that it ties in with whatever assessment system you use in your school.
		</p>

		<p>
			So here you can see an exemplar of a speaking activity that you could use at the end of Year 3 to assess where a child has reached in the age-related expectations.  You can see the different levels of emerging, expected and exceeding, so a child who’s just working towards the age-related expectations for Year 3 would be able to do the very very simple basic introductions to themselves, whereas a child who’s exceeded the age-related expectations for Year 3 would be able to add in quite a lot of extra detail and they may have moved on to expressing likes and dislikes within that link to hobbies or school subjects or food or whatever you’ve been teaching.
		</p>

		<h3 id="sec232">Example</h3>

		<h2 id="sec24" class="chapter">Year 4 Assessment</h2>

		<h3 id="sec241">Assessment Grid</h3>

		<p>
			So now we have the section on speaking and listening taken from the Year 4 assessment grid, again, linking back to the matrix and hopefully at end of Year 4 as a class teacher, you’d be able to tick most of those statements for every child that you teach that they’ve achieved it.  If you want, there is an audio resource if you click on play and you can look at the grid in front of you and see whether you think the child, the recording is working towards those statements, meeting them or exceeding them.
		</p>

		<p>
			So the audio file you’ve just listened to would be for a child who’s reached the age-related expectations for the end of Year 4 and you can see the transcript here and if you’re using the assessment grid, you’ll be able to see that the child has been able to ask a range of questions, they’ve also used greetings, they’ve been able to express an opinion using some of the phrases that we’ve talked about earlier on in the progression matrix.
		</p>

		<p>
			The audio clip that you just heard was for a child who has achieved age-related expectations for the end of year form and you’ll notice in the transcript here, the child has been able to ask a range of questions.  In addition to that, they’ve also been able to use some expressions – they’ve been able to express their opinion in a range of ways.
		</p>

		<h3 id="sec242">Example</h3>

					
		<h3 id="sec25" class="chapter">Suggested Pathway</h3>

		<h3 id="sec251">Year 3 Term 1</h3>

		<p>
			Right, here is a suggested pathway with the emphasis being on ‘suggested’.  By no means do you have to do these things in that order, but this is how we felt that might be useful for you as a guide, how to achieve their objectives for the first year of language learning, looking at a termly basis, so by the end of – by Christmas in the first year, in Year 3, this is where we would see the children should be able to read their objectives for the end of the whole year.  So we’ve got, like, basic introductions, greetings, instructions and then in the words they’ve learned, you know, demonstrate they can say them accurately and that’s it.
		</p>

		<h3 id="sec252">Year 3 Term 2</h3>

		<p>
			We have suggested further pathways, then by Easter, we’ll have a look at some opinions, like, don’t like, possibly there’s curriculum links with other subjects, what they like and don’t like, express their opinions, sound spelling link, pronunciation and moved from 10 up to 14 words and phrases. 
		</p>

		<h3 id="sec253">Year 3 Term 3</h3>

		<p>
			So this pathway could then lead up to – by the end of the first year, to them having those conversations we showed you earlier on the other slide, they perform a song in a group and they reach their level of 20 words and phrases that they can say.  They have also got a good awareness of sounds in the different language.
		</p>

		<h3 id="sec254">Year 4 Term 1</h3>

		<p>
			To enable you to plan for progression, we’ve created some suggested pathways.  So, for example, by the end of Term 1 in Year 4, children should be able to ask and answer simple questions, typically about family, brothers and sisters.  They’ll be starting to understand a wider range of classroom instructions and they’ll be developing greater phonic awareness.
		</p>

		<h3 id="sec255">Year 4 Term 2</h3>

		<p>
			By the end of Term 2 in Year 4, children should be able to talk about favourite food and sport, depending on what topics you’ve been teaching and also start to use more phrases to express an opinion, expressing things, such as like, love, hate, don’t like and they’ll be able to ask for clarification.
		</p>

		<h3 id="sec256">Year 4 Term 3</h3>

		<p>
			So, by the end of Term 3 in Year 4, using the pathway, children should have progressed to be able to presenting more information about themselves.  So, for example, about their age, their family, where they live.  They’ll also be able to respond to a wide range of classroom instructions.  You may want to help them to develop this by allowing a child to give the instructions in the target language each day.  They will also be able to use a certain understanding of intonation, so changing statements to question just by the way that they use intonation in their voice.
		</p>

		
		<h3 id="sec26" class="chapter">Barriers and Solutions</h3>

		<h3 id="sec261">Potential Barriers for Listening</h3>

		<p>
			So here are some of the potential barriers you may encounter when teaching listening skills.  Listening can sometimes be considered to be the least popular skill, certainly the challenge would be that it mustn’t feel like a test that children have to listen and respond to questions and certainly in Year 3 and 4, it’s unlikely that the children will feel like this if you’re using, for example, clips from the BBC of children having conversations in the target language and also it’s important to remember that not every word counts with children, as when they’re listening to English, they need to use a context, they need to use logic and they need to understand that they don’t have to be able to understand every single word, but so long as they can understand the meaning and get meaning from what they’re listening to, that’s a key skill.
		</p>

		<h4 id="sec262">Teaching Ideas</h4>

		<p>
			So here are some suggested teaching ideas that we feel it would engage students in listening, certainly in our experience, so, before they listen to a passage, they could just predict which words or numbers they’re going to hear or the order they’re going to hear some numbers in on a lower level, certainly in the first year of language learning, then obviously linking and listening to performing certain actions and moves that, if you hear this word, not, if you hear another word, move around the classroom, then there’s a wealth of games with mini-whiteboards where they, in response to a listening text, they perform a certain action and draw something, or draw what they hear and in the same way with images, key words, or certain words in front of them so they can highlight whether they have heard them or they connect them from left to right.
		</p>

		<h3 id="sec263">Potential Barriers for Speaking</h3>

		<p>
			One of the main difficulties when teaching speaking, particularly in the early years of language learning, is that the children obviously have a very limited vocabulary and so it’s important that they’re able to have repetition of that vocabulary in a varied way.  Children also need to have the opportunity to speak on a regular basis and also it’s important to be able to plan for the children to use the target language frequently, so, on a daily basis preferably.
		</p>

		<h3 id="sec264">Teaching Ideas</h3>

		<p>
			We’ve put together a list of teaching activities that you might be familiar with or some of them hopefully are new to you, things that we do in our classrooms to foster a climate of speaking and to break down those barriers we’ve just discussed.  So a really popular one is speed dating or question/answer chains where students, they’ll stand or sit in two rows, in two teams and then it would go, the first student asks the question, the second one answers, asks the next student, the next student answers and so on.  You can time both chains if you do it backwards and forwards.  It’s that varied repetition of a small amount of language that we’re trying to address with this activity.  Speed dating means they’re in two circles, an inner and outer facing and then repeat the same question/answer over and over again with different partners.  They can find their partners, you know, with a little profile card and all sorts of characters that tie in with many other curriculum areas and obviously different scenarios, role-playing, you do the same conversation angry, you do it scared, you do it happy, so it’s those kind of, again, as a different celebrity, so these are some teaching ideas.
		</p>

		<h3 id="sec27" class="chapter">Resources</h3>

		<h3 id="sec271">Suggested Resources</h3>

		<p>
			So here you’ll see a range of resources that we use frequently in our language teaching and that we can recommend.  You’ll see the first five of those resources are free to use, in particular, the BBC has some very good resources, particularly with children speaking the target language, native speakers of the target language.  The final one, the Mary Glasgow magazines are really brilliant, they’re up to date, they’re live and they’re very engaging for children.  However, that is a subscription.  You may want to consider doing that with a cluster of schools so that you can share the resources, but there are some free downloads that are available with that in the first place.
		</p>

		<h3 id="sec28" class="chapter">Have A Go!</h3>

		<h3 id="sec281">Demonstration</h3>

		<p>
			So here’s our resource of this session.  You improve speaking and listening and it’s an online resource, it’s free, it’s Voki.com, you might have come across it in English and it’s creating little speaking avatars online which you can then share and do some further work with.
		</p>

		<!--    Start of Reading    -->

		<h1 id="ch3" class="chapter">Reading</h1>

		<h2 id="sec31" class="chapter">Session Objectives</h2>

		<p>
			The aim of this session is to help you gain a lot of confidence in understanding age-related expectations for Year 3 and 4 in reading and will help you to develop an understanding of how to assess progress so that you will understand very clearly whether your children have reached the age-related expectations in Year 3 and 4 for reading and we also have some suggested pathways to help you plan progression across Year 3 and 4.
		</p>

		<p>
			We’ll then look at the barriers specific to reading as a skill and why some children might find it difficult and also what we can do as teachers and different teaching ideas and techniques, how to overcome and address those barriers and we’ll finish with looking at a range of reading resources that are freely available, how to use them and we’ll showcase one resource at the end of the session.
		</p>

		<h2 id="sec32" class="chapter">Age Related Expectations</h2>

		<h3 id="sec321">Progression Matrix</h3>

		<p>
			We’re going to take a careful look at the age-related expectations for reading in Year 3 and 4.  In the white boxes, you can see the DfE statutory requirements for reading across Key Stage 2.  We start off by looking at reading.  In Year 3, obviously, this is the children in the first year of language learning and they’re starting to read some of those familiar words and phrases that you’d be using on an everyday basis.  Moving into Year 4, they’ll be reading those slightly longer phrases that you will be using on an everyday basis, such as how are you, I’m fine, talk about family, so as well as being able to use those verbally, we’re going to be able to read those phrases and recognise them in the written form.  In terms of story, songs and poem, in their first year of language learning, children will be joining in with stories and songs.  So, for example, on the interactive white board you may have some karaoke-style words appearing and children will join in those as a class.  As they move into Year 4, they’ll be able to read possibly a short poem, short stories, those with repeating patterns and that use familiar language to the topics that you’re doing.
		</p>

		<p>
			We’re now looking at the third category which is their vocabulary and enabling them to work out the meaning of new words, using a dictionary as well.  So they, obviously, in the beginning, they just use a simple word list, read those words to find out the meaning of unfamiliar words in a phrase or sentence.  So then using their glossary or a simple dictionary to find out what a new word means and also train them to be able to spot similarities between words in English and other languages and they use cognate and year cognates and then moving on to look at clues, what text type it is, what kind of sentence, which context to work out what a word means that they haven’t seen before.
		</p>

		<h2 id="sec33" class="chapter">Year 3 Assessment</h3>

		<h3 id="sec331">Assessment Grid</h3>

		<p>
			So here you can see the section from the assessment grids for reading by the end of Year 3.  So for children to achieve the age-related expectations, they should be able to do these four things.
		</p>

		<p>
			So here you can see an exemplar of a speaking activity that you could use at the end of Year 3 to assess where a child has reached in the age-related expectations.  You can see the different levels of emerging, expected and exceeding, so a child who’s just working towards the age-related expectations for Year 3 would be able to do the very very simple basic introductions to themselves, whereas a child who’s exceeded the age-related expectations for Year 3 would be able to add in quite a lot of extra detail and they may have moved on to expressing likes and dislikes within that link to hobbies or school subjects or food or whatever you’ve been teaching.
		</p>

		<h3 id="sec332">Examples</h3>

		<p>
			So we’re now going to show you some Exampless of how you could assess reading by the end of children’s first year of language learning and you can see here that we’ve used the 100 Caterpillars, a book that many children will be familiar with and the reason we’ve chosen this, is because it has familiar story, a familiar language, simple structures, so the children are going to be able to follow this without too much trouble.
		</p>  

		<p>
			We’re going to move on have a little look at some of the activities that you can do to check their understanding of the reading of this text.
		</p>

		<p>
			Now take a moment to look at this assessment activity.  If a child is working towards the age-related expectations, you would expect them to be able to match images of the word or the fruit the day that it was eaten.  Children who are working at the expected age range expectations for Year 3, will be able to complete the table.  So, for example, they will be able to put in the image of the fruit in the table on the day that it was eaten and they’ll also be able to express a preference about that fruit, saying whether they like or don’t like it.  If a child is exceeding the age-related expectations, you would have the opportunity to leave out the French translations because, obviously, this means that they have to be able to understand the French days of the week, or Spanish days of the weeks, whichever the target language, and then relate that to what has happened on those various days.
		</p>

		<p>
			Here’s a nice example of an activity that children might be able to access by the end of Year 3.  The reason we like this and we’ve chosen this, is because it’s very clear in terms of the colours, because you have the colour coding as well as the word for the colour and also the cognates will be ones that are familiar for children and even those aren’t, they’re going to be able to use their dictionary skills here to match the item that goes with the various colours and they’ll have a bit of a feel for whether they’ve got it right or not, if the item actually would be that colour.
		</p>

		<p>
			One of the key things to help children really develop good reading skills, is to have a very rich language environment, so, as many of you probably already do make sure that everything in your school is labelled with a target language so that children are seeing it around them all the time, so they can assimilate those words, often without even realising that they’re seeing them all the time, all around them.
		</p>

		<h2 id="sec34" class="chapter">Year 4 Assessment</h2>

		<h3 id="sec341">Assessment Grid</h3>

		<p>
			So here you can see the section on reading from the Year 4 assessment grid based on the progression matrix and the four bullet points of what they are expected to achieve by the end of the second year of language learning.
		</p>

		<h3 id="sec342">Examples</h3>

		<p>
			So here is a sample text of a reading they could access at the end of Year 4 and you can see also they’ve got a glossary that they can use if they haven’t done these topics before which would tick that box.  You can listen, they feature the text on the side and you could also ask them some general comprehension questions, what – tell me one or two things about her ideal bedroom, tell me one or two things she doesn’t like about her current bedroom, to tease out how much they’ve understood.  There’s obviously picture clues here.
		</p>

		<p>
			Here’s an example, another reading example for Year 4.  It’s that repeated pattern that really lends itself to reading same language, that repetition of their relatively small amount of language in different ways.  A great springboard for a writing task afterwards, so they can write their own poem, they can change the means of transport, they can change where they go to and then once they’ve created their own poem, again, it would go back to reading, so then you could put up in the classroom and the library and read each other’s poems and ask questions about them.
		</p>
					
		<h3 id="sec35" class="chapter">Suggested Pathway</h3>

		<h3 id="sec351">Year 3 Term 1</h3>

		<p>
			So here you can see suggested pathway for helping children to reach the age-related expectations by the end of Year 3.  We’ve broken it down into three terms, as a guideline to how you can get those children to the right level by the end of Year 3.  So you can see here, that by the end of Term 1, you would hope, in terms of reading, that children would be able to read simple text with using the very basic vocabulary that you started.  For example, reading about a child who describes the name and their age and this will be a springboard so that speaking, listening activity will enable them to read, not just read to themselves but read it aloud.  They’ll also respond to text that they’ve been reading, so matching greetings and things like that, matching simple information and at this point, you’re hoping for them to broaden their vocabulary.  Actually, often start to have a wider vocabulary than you think because of the exposure to the songs and the games and the activities you’ll have been doing, but certainly, by the end of Term 1, you would hope that the majority of children will be able to read about seven familiar words and phrases.
		</p>

		<h3 id="sec352">Year 3 Term 2</h3>

		<p>
			So by the end of Term 2, in the children’s first year of language learning, they should be able to read about opinions and respond to that by explaining, for example, what somebody liked, what they don’t like.  They’ll also start to use word lists to help them identify key words in text that they’re looking at.  They’ll be using very familiar-type books with the repeating language and hopefully by the end of Term 2, they will be able to read and understand about 10 to 14 familiar words. 
		</p>

		<h3 id="sec353">Year 3 Term 3</h3>

		<p>
			So, by the end of the third term in children’s first year of language learning, they should be able to read the conversations that they’ve actually been having orally but see that in the written form, they’ll be able to fill in gaps appropriately and answer true/false statements.  Children will also be having a greater awareness that some spelling links aren’t always the same in different languages and they will take that into consideration.  So, we’re not saying that the pronunciation will be accurate, but they will understand that certain words and sounds are pronounced differently.  They will gradually increase in their vocabulary and certainly a lot of children will be around 10-20 familiar words and phrases.
		</p>

		<h3 id="sec354">Year 4 Term 1</h3>

		<p>
			At the start of Year 4 then, the second year of language learning, you can see how it slowly moves away, so, so far it’s more or less mirrored the listening and speaking element.  So we’re still reading those long conversation exchanges, personal information, the stories and so on, but now we’re moving to information about other people, the third person.  So, might move away from the conversation they’ve been having so far, so they’re accessing different material in written form and they’ll be able to answer the multiple choice questions and also begin to break down the more complex or compound words or words made up of paths that they do understand, using their glossary, their previous knowledge and extending the vocabulary to about 20/25 familiar words.  Again, that’s just a guideline.
		</p>

		<h3 id="sec355">Year 4 Term 2</h3>

		<p>
			You can see now by the end of Term 2 in their second year of language learning, the recipes is a different type of text type.  We are including opinions, so they can access those in longer conversations in the written text.  They can record and respond to those opinions.  Also, with the vocabulary, they develop their own glossary and they’re beginning to see the words that they know, there’s 25/30 familiar words across different topics of context.  There’s a special focus on the high frequency verbs and words.
		</p>

		<h3 id="sec356">Year 4 Term 3</h3>

		<p>
			So, if you focus in the last term of their second year of language learning, is on the slighter longer text and also introducing more unfamiliar language into their reading resources.  Again, they respond to it, they continue to develop their own glossary and we’ve reached about 30 or more familiar words and phrases and can use them in different contexts which goes beyond the reading.
		</p>

		
		<h3 id="sec36" class="chapter">Barriers and Solutions</h3>

		<h3 id="sec361">Potential Barriers for Reading</h3>

		<p>
			So here are some of the potential barriers that you might find when teaching reading.  Children can be daunted when they first look at a text with lots of foreign language, the target language on the page and it looks completely unfamiliar to them.  So this is why it’s really important to make sure that you choose texts that are appropriate and engaging and this, again, can be a challenge in itself, because often the language will be a lot younger than the children at a cognitive level of development.  Another issue to ensure that the reading techniques are taught so that children can have progression in reading, but obviously that goes along side by side with teaching in their ordinary English lessons.  So same reading techniques apply to reading in the target language.  And also, reading is something that we do need to ensure that we’ve put into lessons so that we move away from the idea that primary language is simply speaking and listening, that children do get those opportunities for regular reading.
		</p>

		<h4 id="sec362">Teaching Ideas</h4>

		<p>
			So here is a selection of teaching ideas and approaches to break down those barriers that children might have in terms of reading.  So, it’s obviously the reading skills, reading lots of different set ups on their own with a partner in groups, with the whole class.  People really focused learning activities that they can access and succeed in, instead of quite broad comprehension questions that they might not be able to access.  A widest possible range of reading materials – I can’t emphasise enough, the similarities to English and how to teach reading for pleasure and enjoying reading in English.  So it’s the same techniques and language-rich classroom and obviously give them the skills to be able to work out words with a list of glossary or a dictionary, so they get more independent.
		</p>

		<p>
			And here are some more hands-on teaching activities to do with reading. So obviously annotations, post-it notes, rebuild the text, give them text, sentences in chunks, put them in the right order, sorting activities.  A favourite of mine is the running dictation, where you have several teams in the class, they all have a dedicated text and then in their teams, they have one person who runs to the text at the back and tells the rest of the group what’s on that in the text and they have to write it down and the first team to write the whole text down on their group table, wins and you can have then all sorts of different levels of difficulty and, obviously, again, emphasising that reading is a great springboard for writing and the other skills, so reading out loud leads nicely to then the role play or asking questions in the target language.

		<h3 id="sec37" class="chapter">Resources</h3>

		<h3 id="sec371">Suggested Resources</h3>

		<p>
			So you can see here a selection of resources that we can recommend to support reading.  The Mary Glasgow publications are really good because they have activities and exercises that go with them.  This is a resource that we have to pay for, however, you may club together with a cluster of schools or you may use some of the free downloadable things from the internet.  Another company that we really like is the European School Books.  They have a really, really wide range of reading books: very colourful, very high quality and across a range of languages and I think that although these books are a little bit expensive, it’s a really good investment in terms of having good quality reading material available for the children.
		</p>

		<p>
			Other things that we recommend are always having the authentic resources.  An example here on instant display that you can print things off, but ideally you get things, like, menus from restaurants in the country where the target language is spoken, posters, advertisements, these kind of things and another website that we like, an organisation, Little Red Language is they have a wide range of animated stories so you’ll be able to use those on contracted white boards or tablets for children to read.

		<h2 id="sec41" class="chapter">Session Objectives</h2>

		<p>
			In this session, we’re going to be taking a close look at the age-related expectations for year 3 and 4 in writing and to be able to help you assess progress in writing, we’re going to be looking at the assessment grids that you’ll be able to use to support you with this.  We’re also going to be looking at some pathways for progression which will show you how children can make the required progress across their first and second year of language learning.
		</p>

		<p>
			We’ll then look at what could stop children gaining confidence in writing and what teaching strategies and teaching activities we can use to overcome those barriers and we’ll finally signpost you to a range of resources and we’ll showcase one resource in a bit more detail.
		</p>

		<h2 id="sec42" class="chapter">Age Related Expectations</h2>

		<h3 id="sec421">Progression Matrix</h3>

		<p>
			Here, we’re going to take a look at the progression matrix, looking in a lot more detail at progression across Year 3 and 4 in writing and you’ll see that by the end of the children’s first year of language learning, they should be able to copy a lot of familiar words but also they’ll be able to write between five to ten words from memory and spelling mostly accurate.  It’s more important that they’re actually having a go at those writing opportunities and we would recommend that right from the outset, children do get the opportunity to start building up their own word banks, either a word book or a section at the back of the writing book that they’re using and they may want to, for example, use it to, kind of, colour-coding system for gender, so from the outset, they’re getting into really good habits and they’ll be able to use that throughout their Key Stage 2 language learning and writing.
		</p>

		<p>
			And then, by the end of their second year of language learning, they’ll still rely heavily on their memory to produce language in writing, but they will be able to then adapt short phrases using familiar words, a wider range of actual sentences and word level and complete texts with words they’ve learnt before and a short description with, again, like a writing frame style support so overall, they make progress towards what’s on the left in white, in the white column, the guidance that’s from the DfE, what they should have achieved by the end of Key Stage 2.
		</p>

		<h2 id="sec43" class="chapter">Year 3 Assessment</h3>

		<h3 id="sec431">Assessment Grid</h3>

		<p>
			Now you can see a section from the assessment grid which looks in detail at writing by the end of Year 3.  If the children can achieve these targets, then we would say that they are hopefully achieving the age-related expectations.
		</p>

		<h3 id="sec432">Examples</h3>

		<p>
			So here you can see an example of what writing might look like by the end of Year 3, and hopefully this will give you some reassurance that children as expected, to write a lot of written work by the end of Year 3.
		</p>  

		<p>
			Here, children have written parts of the body and their spelling is mostly accurate.  You can see they’ve had a good go at the spelling of these words.  What you can see in the red boxes are links to the grammar – an exercise like this would be useful because you’ll be able to assess writing but you’d also be able to link that to assessing grammar as well by the end of Year 3.
		</p>

		<h2 id="sec44" class="chapter">Year 4 Assessment</h2>

		<h3 id="sec441">Assessment Grid</h3>

		<p>
			So here you can see the selection of writing, the age-related expectations that, by the end of their second year of language learning, we’d expect them to hopefully meet those five bullet points.
		</p>

		<h3 id="sec442">Examples</h3>

		<p>
			One of the key things to help children really develop good reading skills, is to have a very rich language environment, so, as many of you probably already do make sure that everything in your school is labelled with a target language so that children are seeing it around them all the time, so they can assimilate those words, often without even realising that they’re seeing them all the time, all around them.
		</p>

				
		<h3 id="sec45" class="chapter">Suggested Pathway</h3>

		<h3 id="sec451">Year 3</h3>

		<p>
			Here you can see a suggested pathway that will help children reach the age-related expectations by the end of year 3 and you can see that children are expected to write phrases from memory.  So in order for them to reach this goal by the end of Year 3, children need to start off by – in term one – copying familiar words enabling greeting words, such as hello, goodbye, moving on to the phrases that they’ll be using in all that they’re doing, such as: “my name is” and “how are you”.  Eventually, by the end of the year, moving on to labelling activities or, indeed, writing some words from memory with accurate spelling.  They’re also beginning to develop the awareness of punctuation and accents, depending on the target language that they’re using and beginning to understand some specific spelling rules – only just beginning though.
		</p>

		<h3 id="sec452">Year 4</h3>

		<p>
			So this continues in Year 4.  We’ve put this suggested pathway together where you can see that the children would start in their journey towards writing phrases from memory by adapting short phrases, simple opinions, then writing a sentence, again, based on the speaking and listening they’ve done in the previous year to them, by the end of their second year of language learning in Year 4 to write three to five simple sentences on familiar topics and work with a poem, poster – it could be a range of different texts.  Their accuracy overall increases, so they can adapt phrases to create the new sentences.  They use their grammatical knowledge of word classes and their personal word bank that they’ve put together and then they keep working at it over the course of their language learning, so that their spelling and punctuation of the words and phrases they’ve learned is correct by the end of their second year of language learning.
		</p>

	
		<h3 id="sec46" class="chapter">Barriers and Solutions</h3>

		<h3 id="sec461">Potential Barriers for Writing</h3>

		<p>
			So now I’m going to look at some of the potential barriers for writing.  It’s clear that in the early days of writing, there’s going to be a mismatch of the cognitive and linguistic learning with children wanting to write more than they have the language ability to do so.  They also can be nervous of making mistakes in their writing because they can be faced with unfamiliar spelling patterns and unsure about the word order, depending on the target language.  This may be compounded by the teacher having a lack of confidence in writing, so the teacher may be more confident with speaking and listening and less confident with the writing activities and also the teacher may be finding it difficult how to integrate the writing with the other skills in order for the children to make progress.  Another problem can be that the children start off with writing those words, but then they do need the opportunity to move from single words into phrases, into sentences and longer pieces of writing, and also finding opportunities for children to write for a real purpose or audience.
		</p>

		<h4 id="sec462">Teaching Ideas - Approach</h4>

		<p>
			So we’re going to look at some of the approaches to writing that you can take that will help the children make that progress in writing in Year 3 and 4.  It’s really important that you do integrate the writing activities from the outset.  So, often, speaking and listening take a lot of priority in Year 3 and 4, but it is important, as often as possible, the children have those opportunities for writing and writing for a purpose, so you may make links, cross-curriculum links, such as in Design &amp; Technology and making books, for example, so the children have opportunities to write simple books with repeating patterns using recipes.  It’s also important that you find topics of interest to the children, so that when they’re writing, they’re able to write about things that engage them and that you do use appropriate levels of support and frameworks so children can feel as if they’re making progress in their writing quite early on.
		</p>

		<h4 id="sec463">Teaching Ideas - Practical Tips</h4>

		<p>
			Right, so here is some teaching activities now to try and break down those barriers and try and have a wide range of activities to vary their writing experience.  So, like, when I do the shared writing at the top, the snowballs, so students, you just give them a smallish piece of paper each and they start writing one sentence.  It could be following a writing frame from the board, so they have to write one sentence about, in the future, you will live in Canada and just put the country, for example, and they scrunch it up and throw I to the front of the class and then pick a snowball and then they write the second sentence, in the future, you will do this, you will be a friend of and they just put the name of the celebrity.  So it can be just something where they just fill in one word and they could choose those words from a selection of words which is also on the board.  It can be very, very structured and supported but they produce a paragraph, together, afterwards and they pick a snowball and then can keep that.
		</p>

		<p>
			Other ideas are obviously ranking, any of those high level thinking skills, activities with words, where there’s more about thinking than about the producing lots of words and also ideas for a creative writing workshops, you might have come across – creating a character, so you can draw a stick man and ask the class, okay, is this a man or a woman, what’s his name, how old is he and quite basically, the same questions that they’ve learned in their first year of language learning, but produce a character and then the class – everybody can produce their own character and over time, those characters could take on hobbies, they could go through all the things you go through topic-wise.  Possibly interact, they could have a physical description, character description.  There’s a lot of mileage in those kind of ideas that can accompany the children through their progress in writing.
		</p>

		<h4 id="sec464">Examples</h4>

		<p>
			So here is an example of the snowball activity that could be on the board and they just write the first sentence, scrunch it up, write the second sentence and you can see the brackets in English, you’ve got the job, city celebrity, luxury article, that could be some dictionary work in Year 4 possibly, or from a glossary or a selection of words you give them.  Or they could brainstorm different vocabulary areas.  Before they start the activities, there are loads of different ways of accessing this and you can see how that’s integrated, you know, as a reading activity as well, and that’s also the idea that cognitive and linguistic level is more closely aligned than in maybe a labelling activity or some other type of writing.
		</p>

		<p>
			Particularly good at the earliest stages of language learning where the students have more, like, a list of words than sentences, it’s pattern or shape poems and you can see examples, so you look at the different words and see how meaning is created by arranging the words in a certain way, or by leaving out words or putting in spaces, you can see in the bottom left corner, the wind, how that blows around and then you can see the word chaos and order and how that’s played with.  He might have spotted the worm in the apple and obviously colour, pattern poems is a great way of giving them a wide range of different writing tasks.
		</p>

		<p>
			On this slide, you can see the different ways of then creating a character, so you can start, if you think at the beginning of the language learning, they know how to say, my name is, I live in, basic family, facts about themselves and this could then culminate in an activity where they write like, I wanted – it could be a teacher, it could be themselves, it could be their friends, it could be for the character they’ve created.  If you think back to that stick man activity, it could be then a class display with all the different posters up in the class and then that could lead to a good reading activity to find the person who, and so on.
		</p>

		<h3 id="sec47" class="chapter">Resources</h3>

		<h3 id="sec471">Suggested Resources</h3>

		<p>
			We’ve put together a list of recommended websites that you can use to help you support writing.  You can see the first one, ‘tagxedo’ and ‘wordle’, both give the children the opportunity to create word plans and other shapes with very limited language, but they can get very nice results from that, and obviously these things would make nice displays in the classroom which really enforce the writing that you’ve been doing in the target language.  Other things that support writing, especially in the early years of writing, are things such as ‘toondoo’ and ‘Comic Life’ where children can do cartoon strips and, again, using quite a limited amount of language, but to get quite good results in terms of creating short stories.  Another one we’re going to look at in a bit more detail like this, is ‘StoryBird’.
		</p>

		<h3 id="sec48" class="chapter">Have A Go!</h3>

		<h3 id="sec481">Demonstration</h3>

		<p>
			The resource we’re looking at in a bit more detail today is StoryBird.com, it’s free.  There is also a paid for version but it’s really enough to get the free version as a teacher and you can get up to 30 student accounts and you can create online picture books, which you can also download but that’s, then, you have to pay for them if you want, you know, to download them, to print them, but you can embed them on websites and blogs and share it that way.
		</p>

		<p>
			Now you can see here, once you log on, you can do a search for art on a theme, or you can just look by artist if you like a certain style and then it collects – it puts all those pictures around a theme or an artist in your – you can see your dashboards, so you’ve got in the middle, where you can drag pictures across and in the white space underneath the big picture, you can then write your story.
		</p>

		<p>
			And here is an example of what it looks like and then it embeds your results on a blog or a web page, or you can just look at them.  There’s a class library function, so the students can, once they’ve logged into StoryBird, they can look at each other’s work, just on the StoryBird website as well and choose stars and there is feedback, leave comments and so on.

		<h1 id="ch5" class="chapter">Grammar</h1>

		<h2 id="sec51" class="chapter">Session Objectives</h2>

		<p>
			In this session we’re going to be focussing on the age-related expectations for Year 3 and 4 in grammar and we’ll be using the assessment grids to help you assess children to progress in grammar.  We’ll also be looking at some suggested pathways to enable the children to make progress across Year 3 and 4 in grammar.
		</p>

		<p>
			We’re also going to look at why some children find grammar difficult, or they struggle with it and then what we can do in terms of teaching approaches or teaching ideas to overcome these problems and finally, we’ll have a look at a range of resources around grammar and we’ll showcase one resource in a bit more detail.
		</p>

		<h2 id="sec52" class="chapter">Age Related Expectations</h2>

		<h3 id="sec521">Progression Matrix</h3>

		<p>
			We’re now going to take a more detailed look at the progression matrix.  On the left, in the white box, as you can see the statutory requirements for MFL and then we can see how it’s been broken into Year 3 and 4, that’s the children’s first and second year of language learning.
		</p>

		<p>
			If we start off by looking at children’s understanding at gender, you can see it’s in Year 3, you’d expect children to start to recognise it in some languages and do have a gender which is signposted by the definite/indefinite article and gradually moving on, they can see, by the end of their second year of language learning that they’re starting to use gender appropriately and they can also see out adjectives may change depending on gender and also they can influence the word order.
		</p>

		<p>
			Another thing that children will be doing is looking at verbs, in particular, the high frequency verbs.  Children in Year 3 will start to use verbs in the present tense on a regular basis.  So, for example, introducing themselves, saying what their name is, saying how old they are and also in terms of second person, when they’re asking a partner a question, such as, ‘how old are you’ and ‘what is your name’, they’ll become familiar with verbs in imperative – so, for example, in classroom commands which you’ll be using on a regular basis and they’ll start to be aware of negative structures in sentences and so by the end of Year 4, children will then, hopefully, have got a – develop an understanding of the third person and they’ll be able to use some of those negative structures in a simple way.  So, for example, in expressing likes and dislikes, they’ll be able to say, ‘I do not like’, for example.
		</p>

		<p>
			So, if we look at the key features and patterns of the language, so especially word order, you can see that students start by developing an awareness, they can understand the question, how it’s different from the statement and in the second year of language learning, in Year 4, they’d move on to understanding how those basic sentences and structures could be extended through adjectives and also through some simple connectives, and, or, but and then they can make a sentence longer.  They might affect the word order again, depending on the target language and they will also move on from understanding a question to have a question if, for instance, the response or the structure of a response sentence and finally, in terms of grammar, seeing how, you know, spelling differences, spelling patterns in English, like, some are the same, some are different, some have been influenced the English by other languages, you know, the conventions of punctuation, it’s like the accents in many languages and then they start to be able to write words down when they’re spelled out by their teacher.
		</p>

		<h2 id="sec53" class="chapter">Year 3 Assessment</h3>

		<h3 id="sec531">Assessment Grid</h3>

		<p>
			So here you can see, the grammar section from the assessment grids for Year 3, and children should be able to achieve all of these things by the end of Year 3, to have achieved the age-related expectations.
		</p>

		<p>
			So here we have exemplified what that might look like by the end of Year 3.  So, by the end of the children’s first year of language learning and you can see that children have been asked here to sort out words into single, plural, masculine and feminine and to highlight the differences between them and you can see at the bottom left of the emerging, expected and exceeding expectations for pupils.
		</p>

		<h2 id="sec54" class="chapter">Year 4 Assessment</h2>

		<h3 id="sec541">Assessment Grid</h3>

		<p>
			So we’re now looking at the section on grammar on the Year 4 assessment grid and what might look like a bit of a daunting long list is actually, when you look at it closer, you can see that a lot of it is part and parcel of the regular teaching activities and the phrases and sentences the students would produce in your lessons would tick lots of those boxes in one go and also the emphasis on recognising and starting to use, instead of being fluid and proficient at any of those, but, we would expect them to meet those bullet points for the age-related expectations in Year 4.
		</p>  

		<h3 id="sec542">Example</h3>

		<p>
			And here, we have put a task together that shows and demonstrates the expectations that we just looked at on the assessment grid.  Just also to emphasis, like, we wouldn’t expect lots of grammar assessment, lots of standard of grammar tests to be done, it’s more, you would be able to assess the grammar through their speaking, their listening and their writing easily but at some point you might have wanted to see what of the grammar they understood, give them a task like that and you can see, so, lots of colour-coding going on, finding the different parts of speech, the genders and plurals, sets of pronouns, you know, write lists of the nouns in groups and so on.
		</p>

		<p>
			So, we’ve put together and revisit now the assessments that we’ve put in place for Year 3 and Year 4 for the different skills and the aim is to show you how you can assess the grammar through those regular assessments that you don’t need a standard of grammar test as I mentioned on the previous slide, so you can see here, if they can produce this in speaking accurately, then they tick a lot of the grammar, bullet points that we looked at for Year 4, in terms of verb ending, word order, questions, statements, opinions, objectives – you can assess whether they can use that correctly or not.
		</p>

		<p>
			So again, another way to assess children’s understanding is their grammar by the end of Year 4, is to take, for example, one of the reading assessments that we’ve looked at previously and you can see if the children are able to read this text and then move on to the activities, which we’ll take a look at in a moment, they will demonstrate that the children can understand the use of grammar.
		</p>

		<p>
			So the activities that the children being asked to do here, link very closely to the grammar objectives and matching the adjectives and nouns and also doing the phrases using adjectives and nouns and so gain, as I said earlier, if the children can do these activities, then it’s a clear demonstration to you that they have fulfilled the grammar objectives for Year 4.
		</p>

		<p>
			So, to finish off the section on Assessment, you can see their writing assessment we discussed a while ago and again, you can see they produce, if you remember, we said the first two lines here, they’re produced independently from memory or from what they’ve learnt before, so you can reassess their grammatical knowledge of word order and verb endings there, an adjective ending and so on and then the next two are produced with a writing frame, but you can see where the gaps, or you could place the gaps so that you could – it makes it easy for you to assess the grammar, whether you leave a gap for an adjective and look at the ending and that it works together with a noun and so on.
		</p>

			
		<h3 id="sec55" class="chapter">Suggested Pathway</h3>

		<h3 id="sec551">Year 3 Term 1</h3>

		<p>
			So now I’m going to take a look at a suggestive pathway to help children make progress across grammar in Year 3, so by the end of Term 1, children should have developed the awareness of nouns and gender.  They will also be able to recognise imperatives through the use of classroom instructions that you’d be using, hopefully on a regular basis and they’ll be noticing simple plurals as well.
		</p>

		<h3 id="sec552">Year 3 Term 2</h3>

		<p>
			By the end of the second term, children will be using regular verbs, first and second person verbs and so, for example, saying what they’re name is in a sentence, saying how old they and asking a partner the same questions.  So they’ll start to recognise a negative sentence, and so they’ll be able to identify words that denote negative sentences in the target language and they’ll be beginning to start to use gender.  This may not be accurate at this stage, but they’ll have an understanding that it needs to be used in certain target languages and they’ll understand the words associated with gender. 
		</p>

		<h3 id="sec553">Year 3 Term 3</h3>

		<p>
			And so by the time children reach Term 3, their first year of language learning, they’ll be using first and second person verbs to ask and answer questions, they’ll be following classroom instructions.  They’ll also be using gender more accurately and they’ll be beginning to use plurals in their spoken and written work.
		</p>

		<h3 id="sec554">Year 4 Term 1</h3>

		<p>
			Moving on to the first term in Year 4 now, so you can see that they’re continuing their work in adjectives and the pronouns.  They can recognise the pattern in the regular verbs, because they’ve already produced them in Year 3, in their speaking, and also in a written text, they can identify a simple negative sentence and point that out, why that is negative.
		</p>

		<h3 id="sec555">Year 4 Term 2</h3>

		<p>
			And, again, continuing from that, they understand that the pronouns follow the gender of the noun, they can look at the word order, changes in adjectives in some languages, they understand the patterns of the verb in the first and the third person instead of having – just using the first person, especially focusing on high frequency verbs for future years and then have a range of simple negative structures and phrases.
		</p>

		<h3 id="sec556">Year 4 Term 3</h3>

		<p>
			At the end of their second year of language learning in Year 4, they are starting to use possessive pronouns correctly.  They use the connectives and can extend their sentences.  They can understand that sometimes a connector might have an impact on word order.  They understand that question parts can help form the answer and they’re using the negative structures that so far they’ve just been able to spot and identify.
		</p>

		
		<h3 id="sec56" class="chapter">Barriers and Solutions</h3>

		<h3 id="sec561">Potential Barriers for Grammar</h3>

		<p>
			So now we’re going to have a look at some of the potential barriers for teaching grammar in Key Stage 2 and some suggestions about how to overcome these barriers.  So one of the issues can be staff confidence, particularly where staff are teaching a language that they’re not very confident with themselves.  So, it can be that they might have found it quite challenging to teach the grammar in the target language.  A suggestion really is for the teachers to make sure that they overcome that fear of teaching grammar and to make sure that grammar does get integrated into all of the lessons, into speaking, listening, into writing really and that teachers are making the grammar explicit, right from Year 3 in all activities so that the grammar underpins everything that the children are doing in the language learning and, of course, the grammar does need to be something that’s purposeful, relevant and firm which we’ll move on to in a moment and activities that can make activities fun rather than sitting down and doing textbook-style exercises of going over grammar points.
		</p>

		<h4 id="sec562">Teaching Ideas</h4>

		<p>
			So we’ve put together a list of teaching and ideas all around the grammar and its starts with something like, find the word in the text, highlight that, put it on a post-it note, like, different challenges, find five adjectives, fine three negatives and so on.  That could be combined with, like, a relay in a race, so they’ve all got different text in their groups and then they – you give them the first challenge and as soon as they’ve found it, they come back to you, give them the second challenge and they run back to their group and say, okay, now we have to find five nouns and then afterwards, they have to find a negative sentence.  So, kind of, working with the text in lots of different ways, or with the grammar in lots of different ways.  Coming up with their own way, with their own song/dance rhyme, rapture under the rule and also with the exception and teach each other – there’s lots of different ways of doing it.  You could also put them in groups, give them a grammar point each, so either they group them, like, masculine/feminine groups or past/present/future groups, or other ideas and then read out a text or sentences and then if their group comes up, they have to either do a noise or do an action or something, just to kind of really force those different grammar categories.
		</p>

		<p>
			So here we’ve put together some display ideas, because it’s really useful if you have got those grammar concepts around in the classroom the whole time to reinforce it.  So that activities that you could do with the children, for example, are doing some of these flowers, or hands, or indeed the spider, to show different verb endings and once the children have done that, then obviously, they’ve done the grammar task, but then they make a really useful display.  These activities would also easily be adaptable to looking at different things, such as pronouns etc., not just verb endings and you can with the hand there that does really enforce personal pronouns as well as the verb endings.
		</p>


		<h3 id="sec57" class="chapter">Resources</h3>

		<h3 id="sec571">Suggested Resources</h3>

		<p>
			So here’s a selection of websites, the place where you can find a bit more ideas about grammar.  We’ll showcase the BBC website in a minute but there’s also, to point that out, for French, that French song database, so you could look for some songs about a grammar point, so it’s very useful, like a tab website with lots of songs, even though the songs themselves might be sometimes too high linguistically, but you can just focus on the grammar and just give the students a quick overview about what the whole song means without going in too much detail and also, especially for Spanish, there’s loads of grammar songs on You Tube using current Top 10 chart hits and then Spanish tutors from around the world have put their own lyrics or classes underneath and that might also be an idea, as a class, to do a bigger song that is currently in the charts and then come up with some kind of text that explains the grammar rule to go with it.
