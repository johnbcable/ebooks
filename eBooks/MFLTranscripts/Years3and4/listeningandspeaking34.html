-2.0cm'><b>Rebecca</b>:       So, by the end of this session, you will have
developed a clear understanding of the age-related expectations for Year 3 and
4, in speaking, listening, and when we refer to Year 3 and 4, we’re talking
about the first and second year of language learning.  By the end of this
session, you’ll also feel confident in assessing progress and speaking and
listening by using the assessment grids which will be shown later in the
session.  But also, hopefully feel more confident in planning for progression,
we will have some sample pathways that you can look at to give you an idea how
you can build progression throughout Year 3 and 4, building on those small
steps to enable the children to reach those age-related expectations at the end
of the year.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:92.7pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:92.7pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
-2.0cm'><b>Bertram:</b>       And the other two things we’ll look at, is
firstly, we’ll have a look and discuss how – what could block progress in
listening and speaking specifically and also at specific teaching ideas and
strategies, how to overcome them and the final thing we’ll look at is, we’ll
signpost you to a range of resources and we’ll showcase, demonstrate one of
them in a bit more detail.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:92.7pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
-2.0cm'><b>Rebecca</b>:       So we’re now going to focus on the age-related
expectations for speaking and listening.  In the white box, you can see the DfE
statutory requirements for the end of Key Stage 2.  Children should be able to
listen and respond spoken language.  In Year 3, this would very much be linked
to language, linked to the families, greetings, introductions, moving on to
topics and themes in Year 4, for example, food or sport.  In Year 3, children
will be able to listen to a range of very simple classroom instruction, such
as, put your hands up, sit down, listen and repeat.  By the time they’re moving
to the end of Year 4, you’d be expecting them to be able to understand
instructions of increasing complexity, such as, talk to your partner, your turn
now and gradually being able to listen to extended instructions and following
those instructions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:92.7pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
-2.0cm'><b>Bertram:</b>       Right, and moving on to speaking.  So we’re
looking at conversations, asking/answering questions, opinions and in Year 3,
sort of, in their first year, we’d expect them to be able to have the generic
introductions about, my name is, what is your name, how old are you, give their
age and then just expanding their vocabulary towards the end of their second
year of language learning, and having a wider range of phrases, so a good
example is, that opinions, when they start off with just saying, I like, I don’t
like, but then they have a wider range they can have more shades of expressing
their opinion from, I love, I like, I really love to, I dislike, I hate certain
things and they also make progress in being able to ask for, can you repeat
that please, can you speak more slowly, moving on from their first year of
language learning where they just say, I don’t understand or communicate that
in different ways.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:92.7pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
-2.0cm'><b>Bertram:</b>       So in this slide, we’re looking at the
pronunciation and phonics and the great thing is, obviously, the children have
a wealth of experience in learning English and using phonics when they learnt
to read and write and so it’s applying that knowledge and their skills on to
their new language which should give them quite a lot of confidence and we’ve
put – you can see, a benchmark there, 20 words at the end of their first year,
they can pronounce accurately and if you think of the examples we gave in the
previous two slides and the conversations, the question/answers that easily is
already 20 words.  You’re not thinking of 20 – like a list of nouns, it’s those
conversations, like words in context meaning.  And obviously then in the second
year of language learning, we’d expect them to then be able to pronounce some new
words using their phonic knowledge that they’ve acquired, but the rules of
pronunciation in the second language and also have a better understanding of
intonation and using that when they speak themselves.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:92.7pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
-2.0cm'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:92.7pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
-2.0cm'><b>Rebecca</b>:       Another of the age-related expectations in MFL is
for the children to be able to present ideas and information orally.  By the
end of Year 3, children should be able to introduce themselves, say how old
they are.  It’s very simple things in word and phrase and they should also be
able to participate in a song within the group setting, so not by themselves,
they’re not expected to perform by themselves.  Moving into Year 4, where
they’d be able to talk a little bit more about themselves, for example, about
their family, about pets and using the new vocabulary for likes and dislikes
and they’d be able to give some simple instructions, and again, using the
classroom instructions that you’ve been developing with them, so not a whole
new range of different instructions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:92.7pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
-2.0cm'><b>Bertram:</b>       This is the speaking and listening section taken
from the Year 3 assessment grid and by the end, it links to the matrix that
we’ve put together, that we’ve discussed in the previous slides and the list of
statements, hopefully, a class teacher would be able to tick and say that each
child in their class has achieved the majority of their statements and it’s
designed so that it ties in with whatever assessment system you use in your
school.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:92.7pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
-2.0cm'><b>Rebecca</b>:       So here you can see an exemplar of a speaking
activity that you could use at the end of Year 3 to assess where a child has
reached in the age-related expectations.  You can see the different levels of
emerging, expected and exceeding, so a child who’s just working towards the
age-related expectations for Year 3 would be able to do the very very simple
basic introductions to themselves, whereas a child who’s exceeded the
age-related expectations for Year 3 would be able to add in quite a lot of
extra detail and they may have moved on to expressing likes and dislikes within
that link to hobbies or school subjects or food or whatever you’ve been
teaching.</p>

-2.0cm'><b>Bertram:</b>       So now we have the section on speaking and
listening taken from the Year 4 assessment grid, again, linking back to the
matrix and hopefully at end of Year 4 as a class teacher, you’d be able to tick
most of those statements for every child that you teach that they’ve achieved
it.  If you want, there is an audio resource if you click on play and you can
look at the grid in front of you and see whether you think the child, the
recording is working towards those statements, meeting them or exceeding them.</p>

you’ll be able to see that the child has been able to ask a range of questions,
they’ve also used greetings, they’ve been able to express an opinion using some

emphasis being on<span style='color:red'> </span>‘suggested’.  By no means do
you have to do these things in that order, but this is how we felt that might
be useful for you as a guide, how to achieve their objectives for the first
year of language learning, looking at a termly basis, so by the end of – by
Christmas in the first year, in Year 3, this is where we would see the children
should be able to read their objectives for the end of the whole year.  So
we’ve got, like, basic introductions, greetings, instructions and then in the

Easter, we’ll have a look at some opinions, like, don’t like, possibly there’s
curriculum links with other subjects, what they like and don’t like, express
their opinions, sound spelling link, pronunciation and moved from 10 up to 14
words and phrases. </p>

be able to talk about favourite food and sport, depending on what topics you’ve
been teaching and also start to use more phrases to express an opinion,
expressing things, such as like, love, hate, don’t like and they’ll be able to
ask for clarification.</p>

pathway, children should have progressed to be able to presenting more
information about themselves.  So, for example, about their age, their family,
where they live.  They’ll also be able to respond to a wide range of classroom
instructions.  You may want to help them to develop this by allowing a child to
give the instructions in the target language each day.  They will also be able
to use a certain understanding of intonation, so changing statements to
question just by the way that they use intonation in their voice.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:92.7pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
-2.0cm'><b>Rebecca:</b>       So here are some of the potential barriers you
may encounter when teaching listening skills.  Listening can sometimes be
considered to be the least popular skill, certainly the challenge would be that
it mustn’t feel like a test that children have to listen and respond to
questions and certainly in Year 3 and 4, it’s unlikely that the children will
feel like this if you’re using, for example, clips from the BBC of children
having conversations in the target language and also it’s important to remember
that not every word counts with children, as when they’re listening to English,
they need to use a context, they need to use logic and they need to understand
that they don’t have to be able to understand every single word, but so long as
they can understand the meaning and get meaning from what they’re listening to,
that’s a key skill.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:92.7pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
-2.0cm'><b>Bertram:       </b>So here are some suggested teaching ideas that we
feel it would engage students in listening, certainly in our experience, so,
before they listen to a passage, they could just predict which words or numbers
they’re going to hear or the order they’re going to hear some numbers in on a
lower level, certainly in the first year of language learning, then obviously
linking and listening to performing certain actions and moves that, if you hear
this word, not, if you hear another word, move around the classroom, then
there’s a wealth of games with mini-whiteboards where they, in response to a
listening text, they perform a certain action and draw something, or draw what
they hear and in the same way with images, key words, or certain words in front
of them so they can highlight whether they have heard them or they connect them
from left to right.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:92.7pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
-2.0cm'><b>Rebecca:       </b>One of the main difficulties when teaching
speaking, particularly in the early years of language learning, is that the
children obviously have a very limited vocabulary and so it’s important that
they’re able to have repetition of that vocabulary in a varied way.  Children
also need to have the opportunity to speak on a regular basis and also it’s
important to be able to plan for the children to use the target language
frequently, so, on a daily basis preferably.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:92.7pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
-2.0cm'><b>Bertram:       </b>We’ve put together a list of teaching activities
that you might be familiar with or some of them hopefully are new to you,
things that we do in our classrooms to foster a climate of speaking and to
break down those barriers we’ve just discussed.  So a really popular one is speed
dating or question/answer chains where students, they’ll stand or sit in two
rows, in two teams and then it would go, the first student asks the question,
the second one answers, asks the next student, the next student answers and so
on.  You can time both chains if you do it backwards and forwards.  It’s that
varied repetition of a small amount of language that we’re trying to address
with this activity.  Speed dating means they’re in two circles, an inner and
outer facing and then repeat the same question/answer over and over again with
different partners.  They can find their partners, you know, with a little
profile card and all sorts of characters that tie in with many other curriculum
areas and obviously different scenarios, role-playing, you do the same
conversation angry, you do it scared, you do it happy, so it’s those kind of,
again, as a different celebrity, so these are some teaching ideas.</p>

use frequently in our language teaching and that we can recommend.  You’ll see
the first five of those resources are free to use, in particular, the BBC has
some very good resources, particularly with children speaking the target
language, native speakers of the target language.  The final one, the Mary
Glasgow magazines are really brilliant, they’re up to date, they’re live and
they’re very engaging for children.  However, that is a subscription.  You may
want to consider doing that with a cluster of schools so that you can share the
resources, but there are some free downloads that are available with that in
the first place.</p>
