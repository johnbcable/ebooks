		<h1 id="ch1" class="chapter">Introduction</h1>

		<p>
			In 2020, we are planning a trip to the land of the rising sun &ndash; Japan &ndash; a bit of a taster trip really as Japan is too vast to cover it all in
			such a short time. Japan was on my personal bucket&ndash;list of places to go to so I am excited to be doing
			this!
		</p>

		
		<p>
			As for the Mexico/Cuba ebook, this eBook is divided into 3 main sections, namely:
			<ul>
				<li>Stuff to do before we go,</li>
				<li>The trip itself, and</li>
				<li>Coming home at the end</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<p>
			If I think of any other stuff I&apos;ll put it into appendices at the end. So, without further ado, let&apos;s crack on!
		</p>

		<h1 id="ch2" class="chapter">Before We Go</h2>

		<p>
			Well, before we start our trip, there are a few things to think about and do. I have split these up as follows:
			<ul>
				<li>Background: why we are going at this time of year, weather, distances etc.</li>
				<li>Health: what we need to do before we go (in terms of innoculations, tablets etc.)</li>
				<li>Travel: what our outbound long&ndash;haul flight details are, any considerations about time left on passports etc.</li>
				<li>Money: what the local currency is, advice from journey planners re use of credit cards etc.</li>
				<li>Miscellaneous: duty free precautions, electrical supply etc.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<p>
			I have also included as an Appendix what I envisage packing for the trip (excluding clothing - I am sure you can make up your own minds about clothing!).
		</p>

		<h2>Background</h2>

		<p>
			We are visiting Japan in late March/early April so we can catch the &apos;blossom season&apos;&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;
			a very popular tourist time of year for foreign tourists and for the Japanese themselves. 
		</p>

		<p>
			This is one of the best times to visit as it precedes the major foreign tourist season from May through September. 
			We fly out of the UK on <strong>Friday 22<sup>nd</sup> March</strong> and return on <strong>Sunday 6<sup>th</sup> April</strong>.
		</p>

		<p>
			The weather forecast whe we are in Japan is likely to be

		<p>
			So, not hot and occasional nights when overnight temperatures are cold. Take decent overnight gear and a light 
			waterproof for showers is my best advice. Layers will be the order of the day. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Japan is a country of approx. 121 million people and nearly four hundred thousand square kilometres in size made up from 6852 islands. 97% of the land area is taken up by the 5 main islands (Hokkaido, Honshu, Kyushu, Shikoku, and Okinawa); for comparison, the UK has a population of approaching 70 million people crammed into nearly 250,000 square kilometres of land mass (and we only have 136 permanently inhabited islands). 
		</p>

		<img src="./images/Resized/Japan-map.png" width="400px" />

		<p>
			Our holiday will be almost exclusively on the main Honshu island:<br />
			<ul>
				<li>Kyoto &ndash; including Golden Pavilion, bamboo forest, geisha and cherry blossoms</li>
				<li>Hiroshima &ndash; includng Hiroshima itself and Miyajima island (with floating Torii gate)</li>
				<li>Tokyo &ndash; including Kamakura (day trip - optional?) and Tokyo itself (with the SkyTree tower)</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<h2>Health</h2>

		<p>
			Do check with your GP about what innoculations they advise for your personal circumstances for this trip. They will normally check for whether you are up to date with vaccines for cholera, typhoid, Hepatitis A and Tetanus.
		</p>

		<p>
			Make sure and get them to bring your vaccination record card up to date and store it somewhere safe.
		</p>

		<p>
			Hampton GP surgery also gave me two web sites to check:
			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://nathnac.net/">National Travel Health Network and Centre </a>, and</li>
				<li><a href="https://www.fitfortravel.nhs.uk/home">Fit For Travel</a></li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<p>
			From those web sites for Japan: travellers should be up to date with routine vaccination courses and boosters as recommended in the UK. These vaccinations include for example measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine and diphtheria-tetanus-polio vaccine. We are unlikely to need a vaccine for Japanese encephalitis as we are not spending protracted time in rice fields, swamps or marshes. Similarly, rabies risk is low in Japan and confined to bites from bats so we again will probably not have a course of rabies vaccine. We should not eat or drink unpasteurised milk products to avoid tick-borne encephalitis, but again this is marked as very low risk and no vaccine recommended.
		</p>

		<p>
			There is no mentioned risk of Yellow Fever in visting Japan.
		</p>

		<a id="travel"><h2>Travel</h2></a>

		<p>
			Japan is in a different time zone to the UK - they are 9 hours in front of us.<br />
		</p>


		<p>
			We are travelling a significant distance during this holiday, both by air and by road. The table below shows our two long-haul flights to and from Japan. The remainder of the holiday travel within Japan is by road and rail.

		<hr />

		<p>
			Lesley and I will each have a &quot;travel pack&quot; with printed copies of our travel documentation in plus other stuff to do with the trip. We will also have our Japanese currency split up between us.
		</p>
-->
		<h2>Money</h2>

		<p>
			Japan has the yen as its unit of currency.
		</p>

		<p>
			Although Japan is high-tech, we have been advised to take sufficient cash as many places e.g. some restaurants, shops
			etc. do not accept debit or credit card payments. Weird eh? As with any holiday abroad, you are recommended
			to let your bank know that you will be using your card(s) in Japan before you leave.
		</p>

		<p>Current exchange rate (as at Saturday 14 September) is 135 Yen to the pound.<br /></p>

		<p>
			Credit cards (and pre-paid credit cards such as FairFX) are accepted for certain things in Japan e.g. trains
			tickets, hotels (maybe not ryokan, though?)
		</p>

		<!--
		<p>
			Tipping is expected in both Mexico and Cuba, so expect to do this for most things except straight shops, market stalls etc. It is often more useful to give the tip in local currency; however in Cuba locals may not legally be able to use CUC&apos;s (Cuban tourist pesos). Rule of thumb guidelines (but only if you are happy with the service)may be:
			<ul>
				<li>Hotel porters:  $1 per bag (equivalent in local currency)</li>
				<li>Hotel housekeeping: 50 cents to $1 per night </li>
				<li>Taxi drivers: normal practice to round up fare. Agree rates in advance is best</li>
				<li>Restaurants: 10%. If service charge already added, round up to nearest full figure.</li>
				<li>Local guides: on average equivalent to $10 per day per couple. Private tours may double this.</li>
				<li>Drivers: don&apos;t forget them but lower amount than guides.</li>
			</ul><br /><br />
			More advice in the travel dossier.
		</p>

		<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>

		<h3>Duty Free Precautions</h3>

		<p>
			Approximately 1 litre of spirits may be brought in from Cuba to Mexico per person.
		</p>

		<p>
			A popular item that travellers buy at duty-free in Cuba is the famous Havana Rum. However, many travellers have also reported that they then have it confiscated from them when going through a connecting airport such as LA or Madrid. This is because it is compulsory for any alcohol to be sealed in a <strong>duty-free clear plastic bag with the receipt inside it</strong>. Duty free officials in Cuba are lax about putting receipts INSIDE the clear plastic bags so watch out. Without this, it means that going through check in at the connecting airport the customs officials will then be legally obligated to throw it away or alternatively, check it in as luggage at an extra cost.
		</p>

		<p>
			May be better to purchase within the country and pack safely in the suitcase, not in carry-on bags? 
		</p>

		<h3>Wifi and Phones</h3>

		<p>
			In Mexico, accessing hotel wifi is easy and generally complientary. This extends to many coffee bars and restaurants. So we should try and confine our Whatsapp use to wifi connections unless in an emergency. Don&apos;t forget to turn off mobile data when not connected to wifi!. Cuba is a different story when it comes to phones and internet though! Prior to 2015, there wasn’t really any internet connection in Cuba although things have improved a bit since then. The national phone company, ETECSA, have created hotspots so you just buy a prepaid internet card to access the internet. Connection is slow but possible and you can get the internet cards at most hotels as well as ETECSA shops.
		</p>

		<p>
			We may or may not be able to print our boarding cards for flights when we are away. Advice from Journey Latin America about this is: &quot;Hotels sometimes offer printing although not always and often for a charge. (They) would advise downloading the Aeromexico app to check in online. All flights are confirmed with seats booked though so you should be fine if you’re unable to check in online.&quot;
		</p>

		<h3>Electricity</h3>

		<p>
			The voltage in Japan is 100 Volt, which is different from North America (120V), Central Europe (230V) and most other regions of the world. Japanese electrical plugs and outlets resemble North American ones. Plugs come in various versions, but most commonly they are non-polarized and ungrounded with two pins.

		<p>
			So we will need travel adapters and (maybe) voltage adapters as well so we can have our 4-way blocks plugged in at our various accommodations.

		<h1 id="ch3" class="chapter">The Trip &ndash; Potentials</h1>

		<h4>Tokyo</h4>

		<p>
			Lots to see here - so busy and yet nowehere near as noisy as UK and US cities (apparently)! For example, the Shinjuku
			area near Tokyo's station. Include Izakaya tour (An izakaya is a type of informal Japanese pub. They are
			casual places for after-work drinking. They have been compared to Irish pubs, tapas bars and early American
			saloons and taverns.) and Robot Restaurant (not a restaurant) - EDWARD
		</p>

		<h4>Kyoto</h4>

		<p>
			Here the Philosophers Walk (or Path) is a great place to enjoy the cherry blossoms. in northern Kyoto. Small
			coffee shops exist on this walk/path. 2km long and would take about 1.5 hours to walk both ways. We also have the Golden Pavilion, bamboo forest and Inari shrine and approach walk.
		</p>

		<h4>Mount Fuji</h4>

		<p>
			Iconic, must see place. Maybe combine with a Ryokan stay with views to Mt Fuji?
		</p>

		<h4>Walk Some of the Nakasendo Way</h4>

		<p>
			From Joanna Lumley programme, 5-mile stretch from Tsumago to Magome (or the other way - whichever is most
			convenient). Lovely scenery and distance is manageable &ndash; just over 2 hours (7.9km). Our tour itinerary is likely to only give us a one-hour stretch of this walk from either Tsumago or Magome, not the whole thing.
		</p>

		<h4>Shinkansen &ndash;</h4>

		<p>
			Bullet train ride. Several opportunities as several lines exist e.g. Tokyo to Kyoto.
		</p>

		<h4>Ryokan stay</h4>

		<p>
			Typical (stereotypical?) Japanese guest house stay. Also try hot spring bathing and banquet dinner EDWARD
		</p>

			<h4>Pontocho Alley</h4>

		<p>
			Another EDWARD recommendation - in Kyoto
		</p>

		<h4>Miyajima Island</h4>

		<p>
			Includes Floating torii gate, lots of deer EDWARD
		</p>
