		<h1 id="ch1" class="chapter">Introduction</h1>

		<p>
			In 2020, we are planning a trip to the land of the rising sun &ndash; Japan, at the blossom time of year
			(late March - early April) &ndash; a bit of a taster trip really as Japan is too vast to cover it all in
			suhc a short time. Japan was on my personal bucket&ndash;list of places to go to so I am excited to be doing
			this!
		</p>

		
		<p>
			This eBook is divided into 3 main sections, namely:
			<ul>
				<li>Stuff to do before we go,</li>
				<li>The trip itself, and</li>
				<li>Coming home at the end</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<p>
			If I think of any other stuff I&apos;ll put it into appendices at the end. So, without further ado, let&apos;s crack on!
		</p>

		<h1 id="ch2" class="chapter">Before We Go</h2>

		<p>
			Well before we start our trip, there are a few things to think about and do. I have split these up as follows:
			<ul>
				<li>Background: why we are going at this time of year, weather, distances etc.</li>
				<li>Health: what we need to do before we go (in terms of innoculations, tablets etc.)</li>
				<li>Travel: what our outbound long&ndash;haul flight details are, any considerations about time left on passports etc.</li>
				<li>Money: what the local currency is, advice from journey planners re use of credit cards etc.</li>
				<li>Miscellaneous: duty free precautions, electrical supply etc.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<p>
			I have also included as an Appendix what I envisage packing for the trip (excluding clothing - I am sure you can make up your own minds about clothing!).
		</p>

		<h2>Background</h2>

		<p>
			WE are visiting Japan in late March/early April so we can catch the &apos;blossom season&apos;&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;a very popular tourist time of year for foreign tourists and for the Japanese themselves. 
		</p>

		<p>
			This is one of the best times to visit as it precedes the major tourist season from May through September. We fly out of the UK on <strong>Friday 22<sup>nd</sup> March</strong> and return on <strong>Sunday 6<sup>th</sup> April</strong>.
		</p>

		<p>
			The weather forecast whe we are in Japan is likely to be

		<p>
			So, not hot and occasional nights when overnight temperature are cold. Take decent overnight gear and a light waterproof for showers is my best advice. Layers will be the order of the day. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Japan is a country of approx. 121 million people and nearly 2 million square kilometres in size; for comparison, the UK has a population of approaching 70 million people crammed into nearly 250,000 square kilometres of land mass. 
		</p>

		<img src="./images/Resized/Japan-map.jpg" width="400px" />

		<p>
			Our holiday will be almost exclusively on the main Honshu island<br />
			<ul>
				<li>Kyoto &ndash; including Golden Pavilion, bamboo forest, geisha and cherry blossoms</li>
				<li>Hiroshima &ndash; inclduing Hiroshima itself and Miyajima island (incl. floating Torii gate)</li>
				<li>Tokyo &ndash; including PKamakura (day trip?) and Tokyo itself (incl. SkyTree)</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<h3>Cuba</h3>

		<img src="./images/Resized/map-cuba.png" width="400px" />

		<p>
			Our visit to Cuba will only take in two areas:<br />
			<ul>
				<li>Havana &ndash; Cuba&apos;s bustling capital city on the north-west coast, and</li>
				<li>Trinidad &ndash; coastal town on south coast passing through the Santa Clara region</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<h2>Health</h2>

		<p>
			Do check with your GP about what innoculations they advise for your personal circumstances for this trip. They will normally check for whether you are up to date with vaccines for cholera, typhoid, Hepatitis A and Tetanus &ndash; I had to have a tetanus jab and a Hepatitis A one as well (because I only had a combined Hep A + B jab when we travelled to Vietnam and Cambodia which only lasts for a short time).
		</p>

		<p>
			Make sure and get them to bring your vaccination record card up to date an store it somewhere safe.
		</p>

		<p>
			Hampton GP surgery also gave me two web sites to check:
			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://nathnac.net/">National Travel Health Network and Centre </a>, and</li>
				<li><a href="https://www.fitfortravel.nhs.uk/home">Fit For Travel</a></li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<p>
			I did ask about rabies and malaria. Alhough both countries are tropical, malaria risk is classed as Low and Hampton GP&apos;s are not recommending a course of malaria tablets for our visit. The risk of rabies is roughly the same for Cuba/Mexico as it was for Vietnam/Cambodia. The rabies jab does not offer full protection anyway; it just delays the progress of rabies if you have been bitten until you can get to some proper medical facilities. That being the case, we may do the same as we did for Vietnam/Cambodia &ndash; not have the rabies jab &ndash; and remain careful while on holiday around animals.
		</p>

		<p>
			The tour company did mention about having an up&ndash;to&ndash;date Yellow Fever vaccination record or you might not get back into the UK but the Hampton Surgey dismissed that - see what your own GP&apos;s say where you are.
		</p>

		<a id="travel"><h2>Travel</h2></a>

		<p>
			Japan is in a different time zone to the UK - they are 8 hours in front of us.<br />
		</p>

			We are travelling a significant distance during this holiday, both by air and by road. The table below shows the main travelling and what the distances involved are for each major trip.

		<p>
			N.B. <br />
			<ol>
				<li>
					All departure and arrival times are local so don&apos;t forget about <a href="#travel">different time zones</a> for Mexico and Cuba when calculating journey times.
				</li>
				<li>
					 For those composite flights, where we make an intermediate stop, the original advice from Journey Latin America was that our bags will go all the way through. However, for the international flight from Heathrow arriving into Mexico City, they now tell us that we will need to pick up our luggage and clear customs as it&apos;s our first point of entry into Mexico. Then we will need to bag-drop for the second flight &ndash; all in a period of 1 hour and 45 minutes (provided we are not late into Mexico City). Challenging. This will also be the same on our return flight from Havana into Mexico City.
				</p>
				<p>
					Flying on AeroMexico is apparently easier than other airlines because you arrive and depart from the same terminal (terminal 2). We will check with AeroMexico in London when we check in.

		<p>
			It is worth noting that a Cuban tourist card is compulsory for entering Cuba. We have been issued with these for each of us from Journey Latin America. We will need to produce the document at customs, <strong>as well as valid travel insurance</strong> to be allowed to enter. Without them both, we risk being turned away after landing.
		</p>

		<hr />

		<p>
			Lesley and I will each have a &quot;travel pack&quot; with printed copies of our travel documentation in plus other stuff to do with the trip. We will also have our foreign currency split up between us.
		</p>
-->
		<h2>Money</h2>

		<p>
			Japan has the yen as its unit of currency.
		</p>

		<p>
			Although Japan is high-tech, we are advised to take sufficient cash as many places e.g. restaurants, shops
			etc. do not accept debit or credit card payments. Weird eh? As with any holiday abroad, you are recommended
			to let your bank know that you will be using your card(s) in Japan before you leave.
		</p>

		<p>Current exchange rates (as at Saturday 14 September) is 135 Yen to the pound.<br /></p>

		<p>
			Credit cards (and pre-paid credit cards such as FairFX) are accepted for certain things in Japan e.g. trains
			tickets, hotels (maybe not ryokan, though?)
		</p>

		<!--
		<p>
			Tipping is expected in both Mexico and Cuba, so expect to do this for most things except straight shops, market stalls etc. It is often more useful to give the tip in local currency; however in Cuba locals may not legally be able to use CUC&apos;s (Cuban tourist pesos). Rule of thumb guidelines (but only if you are happy with the service)may be:
			<ul>
				<li>Hotel porters:  $1 per bag (equivalent in local currency)</li>
				<li>Hotel housekeeping: 50 cents to $1 per night </li>
				<li>Taxi drivers: normal practice to round up fare. Agree rates in advance is best</li>
				<li>Restaurants: 10%. If service charge already added, round up to nearest full figure.</li>
				<li>Local guides: on average equivalent to $10 per day per couple. Private tours may double this.</li>
				<li>Drivers: don&apos;t forget them but lower amount than guides.</li>
			</ul><br /><br />
			More advice in the travel dossier.
		</p>

		<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>

		<h3>Duty Free Precautions</h3>

		<p>
			Approximately 1 litre of spirits may be brought in from Cuba to Mexico per person.
		</p>

		<p>
			A popular item that travellers buy at duty-free in Cuba is the famous Havana Rum. However, many travellers have also reported that they then have it confiscated from them when going through a connecting airport such as LA or Madrid. This is because it is compulsory for any alcohol to be sealed in a <strong>duty-free clear plastic bag with the receipt inside it</strong>. Duty free officials in Cuba are lax about putting receipts INSIDE the clear plastic bags so watch out. Without this, it means that going through check in at the connecting airport the customs officials will then be legally obligated to throw it away or alternatively, check it in as luggage at an extra cost.
		</p>

		<p>
			May be better to purchase within the country and pack safely in the suitcase, not in carry-on bags? 
		</p>

		<h3>Wifi and Phones</h3>

		<p>
			In Mexico, accessing hotel wifi is easy and generally complientary. This extends to many coffee bars and restaurants. So we should try and confine our Whatsapp use to wifi connections unless in an emergency. Don&apos;t forget to turn off mobile data when not connected to wifi!. Cuba is a different story when it comes to phones and internet though! Prior to 2015, there wasn’t really any internet connection in Cuba although things have improved a bit since then. The national phone company, ETECSA, have created hotspots so you just buy a prepaid internet card to access the internet. Connection is slow but possible and you can get the internet cards at most hotels as well as ETECSA shops.
		</p>

		<p>
			We may or may not be able to print our boarding cards for flights when we are away. Advice from Journey Latin America about this is: &quot;Hotels sometimes offer printing although not always and often for a charge. (They) would advise downloading the Aeromexico app to check in online. All flights are confirmed with seats booked though so you should be fine if you’re unable to check in online.&quot;
		</p>

		<h3>Electricity</h3>

		<p>
			Both Mexico and Cuba have different electricty supply and plug sockets to the UK. In Mexico the power sockets are of type A and B. The standard voltage is 127 V and the standard frequency is 60 Hz. In Cuba the power sockets are of type A, B, C and L. The standard voltage is 110 / 220 V and the standard frequency is 60 Hz. Pictures of the various socket types are shown below.
		</p>

		<table cellpadding="5" border="0">
			<tr>
				<td><img src="./images/TypeASocket.jpg" width="150px" height="130px" alt="Type A Socket"></td>
				<td><img src="./images/TypeBSocket.jpg" width="150px" height="130px" alt="Type B Socket"></td>

		<p>
			So we will need travel adapters and (maybe) voltage adapters as well so we can have our 4-way blocks plugged in at our various accommodations.

		<h1 id="ch3" class="chapter">The Trip &ndash; Potentials</h1>

		<h4>Tokyo</h4>

		<p>
			Lots to see here - so busy and yet nowehere near as noisy as UK and US cities! For example, the Shinjuku
			area near Tokyo's station. Include Izakaya tour (An izakaya is a type of informal Japanese pub. They are
			casual places for after-work drinking. They have been compared to Irish pubs, tapas bars and early American
			saloons and taverns.) and Robot Restaurant (not a restaurant) - EDWARD
		</p>

		<h4>Kyoto</h4>

		<p>
			Here the Philosophers Walk (or Path) is a great place to enjoy the cherry blossoms. in northern Kyoto. Small
			coffee shops exist on this walk/path. 2km long and would take about 1.5 hours to walk both ways.
		</p>

		<h4>Mount Fuji</h4>

		<p>
			Iconic, must see place. Maybe combine with a Ryokan stay with views to Mt Fuji?
		</p>

		<h4>Walk Some of the Nakasendo Way</h4>

		<p>
			From Joanna Lumley programme, 5-mile stretch from Tsumago to Magome (or the other way - whichever is most
			convenient). Lovely scenery and distance is manageable &ndash; just over 2 hours (7.9km)
		</p>

		<h4>Shinkansen &ndash;</h4>

		<p>
			Bullet train ride. Several opportunities as several lines exist e.g. Tokyo to Kyoto.
		</p>

		<h4>Ryokan stay</h4>

		<p>
			Typical (stereotypical?) Japanese guest house stay. Also try hot spring bathing and banquet dinner EDWARD
		</p>

		<h4>Golden Palace</h4>

		<p>
			No idea what this is or where EDWARD
		</p>

		<h4>Pontocho Alley</h4>

		<p>
			Another EDWARD recommendation
		</p>

		<h4>Miyajima Island</h4>

		<p>
			Includes Floating torii gate, lots of deer EDWARD
		</p>

		<h4>Takayama Destival</h4>

		<p>
			Depends on timing EDWARD
		</p>
